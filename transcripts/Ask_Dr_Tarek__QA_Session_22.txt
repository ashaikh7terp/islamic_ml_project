welcome everyone to our open uh forum for questions and answers our monthly Forum uh inshallah this will be uh the last one before Ramadan or maybe that's not true maybe we will have one more affordable anyway but there are a lot of Ramadan Associated questions um there are quite a few questions in tonight's session some of them several of them are are quite you know will require some a little bit more explanation than I usually give so we'll try to give them their do right but a lot of them are just simple so we'll also breathe through those inshallah okay so without you know I don't these are again anonymous questions I don't know who sent them and I without any in just a random order the first question can you explain the significance of the future can you explain the significance of the 15th of shaben and is it a sooner to fast on that day are there any special prayers to observe on that the 15th of Shaban or the eve of the 15th later tonight the eve of the 15th of Shabani the night before is a night that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam spoke about and there are several Hadith Traditions to that effect that basically the sum of those Hadith mean that the orders of of Qatar the orders of Destiny the things that have been written for the year descend from the preserved tablet and are given to the angels and sent out um for distribution and it is a Sunnah to fast the day of the 15th and it is a Sunnah that the eve of the 15th that we engage in Acts of worship and there is a Sunnah Dua uh which you can find on my website I have it for you in Arabic English and transliteration um which is the Dua comes from various Sunnah traditions and at the very least do that Dua before you sleep the Dua is like you know it will take you one one whole minute to read it's it's not that long and if you are able to fast on the following day you're able to fast because this is a day that prepares us for what will come which is the month of Ramadan especially it's also the prophet is these type of celestial events would take place like the idea of the Qatar being distributed Etc he would like to be in a state of fasting and so because we are now in it's right around the corner what is the significance of Attica are women allowed to do Arctica at iccp if we stay at the chapel Rose premise are we allowed to do article will it qualify or is it distant from the main mosque after calf is a meritorious act it is an act that the prophet Allah himself engaged in even before he received revelation is now there's a difference of opinion if Attica has to be associated with fasting in the hanafi method it has to be associated with fasting but in the Shafi method it's a standalone thing so in the Sharif if you're going to the mosque the for anything you can just intend okay the moments that I'm going to be in the most are moments of attic F and you'll be rewarded as such as it comes in the month of Ramadan as it comes to the month of Ramadan rather it is a Sunnah that the last 10 days uh one engages in the spiritual retreat at the Kev as was the custom and the Sunnah of the Prophet now part of the conditions of is that it has to be in the mosque that's one of the conditions so in the case of Chapel Road because it is not part of iccp formally as part of the Masjid it would not count as Attica the Attica would have to take place in the mosque proper because that's one of the conditions of Attica however when it comes to women specifically in the hanafi method and in one of the positions of the it is permissible for a woman to perform her Attica in her home Muslim if there's a place in her home that she usually uses for usually uses for prayer according to that opinion it is permissible for her to engage in act to care in that space which is something for women so that's an easy that's an easy one to solve I thought a lot about the Chapel Road and things like that and you know when it comes when it comes to uh to Kev the condition of it being a mosque you have to just come back to the legality of the properties that we have and because of the way the legality is structured we would not consider uh the Chapel Road property to be a part of the mosque from the point of view of you know things like this but there's also advantage for it not being part of the most proper because there are certain rules that have that that we have with mosques uh that will not apply to that property and therefore there are some um we have more we can get more use out of that property accordingly now that might change in the future that's and then we can revisit this issue okay ICC the ICC Barn is the property of iccp okay sorry there's a follow-up question is can you do the attack in the barn you know I would come back and say no we would have to do at the Kev again in the mosque itself because that would be oops yeah we have to do at the cap in the mosque itself and in that regard our mosque is on the smaller size I mean the Masala part of the mosque is on the smaller size so that would you know put some restraints to the number of people inshallah we have the activity building up we will be able to increase uh increase that do we break our fast or ablution by taking a drop of blood for sugar test you mean uh uh if you if you prick your finger if you prick your finger that's an intramuscular injection like the prick is intramuscular that wouldn't break none of that breaks your ablution but that wouldn't break your fast but if you drew blood from a vein or an artery that would break your fast so intramuscular injections do not break the fast intra venous injections break the fast because the veins and the arteries are considered part of the body cavity so anything that is introduced inside the body cavity from outside that's the definition of of the fast so if it's just a prick like on your finger you know like you have to you know for the blood sugar test that would be okay is it all right for me to follow the Imam at tarawiya by reading the specific chapter or page he is reciting you can have the Quran in your hand you can have the musaf in your hand and you can follow along there is an opinion that allows that and this comes from the Quan uh who was the servant of or of say the Isha alaihissalam and he used to lead her in the Muslim and based on that the chef I took that it's permissible okay um can I wait until sorry can I wait yeah I think it's until can I wait until the event is set for Fajr to start my fast no the minute you hear them and then say the first letter of the then the hems of Allah Allah the minute he says that that is when the fast begins now of course we don't live in a Muslim majority country where we are just relying on then outside and we have a timetable so whatever the time is for Fajr let's say 10 15 seconds before that time is when you have to stop eating and drinking uh and that's when the fast begins so for the event for any prayer for that then to be valid it has to be said by them and then after the actual time of the prayer has occurred in the Muslim majority world what they have done is that in the timetables that the mosques follow they have added in those extra seconds in the beginning it's called the temkin they've asked it added a little bit patted at the time so like I'm in Cairo right now if I hear that then I know that for sure the prayer time has started in our case because we don't necessarily have that and we are looking at the calculated prayer times you know we'll just stop a few moments before the publish time now of course this brings up another issue which is which is the federal time and the chat time because there are different calculations because feder and Aisha specifically those two prayers are calculated based on an assumed angle of the sun either the sun below the Horizon as it rises in the East or the sun below the Horizon in the west uh as it as it continues its journey I mean from our perspective that is so the different angles there are different silk bodies that have different angles now you will know notice that if you there can be great discrepancies between the fedger and the aishat times because each degree that the sun moves is four minutes so if there's a 10 degree difference that's 40 minutes there'll be 40 different minutes now I I personally have my view on the correct angle for the fedger time and I haven't necessarily made this a big deal at the mosque because there it is it is a little bit of a matter of HD head and therefore I don't want to uh I don't want to create a fitness or something like that but since the question this is you know the second type of question I've gotten in the last year that has to do with the federal at times it's I think it's important to mention that okay so again just to summarize as far as the question goes before the published time of Fajr that's when you have to stop eating and drinking and you will begin your fast now maybe sorry just another point maybe the questioners also thinking of another issue which happens which is that in some Muslim majority regions there is an and then before the fetchup like I go to Amman Jordan frequently and they do the priyam Fajr so maybe 20 minutes before federal or something like that there's an event and I remember my first night in my recent trip I was like wait is that Federal but my the app says it's not Fajr and then I noticed he didn't say I was like ah this is the event of PM to wake people up for crem that and then it's like an alarm clock so and and Bilal used to or and some of the evidence of the Prophet I saw some used to do that that and then is to wake people up that's different that that's not pinned to the time of the prayer it's just a way of waking people up that's okay you can eat and drink through that if you are in a region that has that event but you got to make sure so you have to understand what's going on okay is there a special significance in breaking your fast with eating dates some say that the prophet saws ate seven dates Etc he the prophet said if one of you breaks your fast let them break your fast with dates and if they can't find the dates then with water uh it's narrated in dawood and other collections so the Sunnah is to break our our fast with dates water and or water and an odd number of dates because the prophet is used to like to do those type of things in odd numbers so that's where it comes from and there's also a lot of health benefits to the nutrients and and that and and the the contents of the date itself on an empty stomach there's a lot of uh nutrients but don't you know don't say oh he liked odd numbers I'm going to eat 21 day I mean don't overdo it just just have a few dates inshallah we are told that there's a special time between us in Ramadan the duas are heard is there a Hadith the time between Arsenal and Merlin in which the Dua is answered is on the day of jummah that the prophet said that there's a Time on Juma uh that and you know by following the different Hadith it's it's between us and margarita time so that's a time that we seek out to make uh Dua foreign a lot of advises us admonishes us to keep the middle prayer in the middle prayer is the Asar prayer because it's in the middle of the day and it's in the middle of the prayers if you look at from the night before to from or if you look at it from the day a lot of the elements understood that to be the awesome prayer some people said it's feasure prayer but if we go to the hospital prayer then it's a special time and the reason it's a special time it's a time that most people are absolutely minded of people are not thinking just like the early mornings you know most people are not up in the morning and you know out and about so those times tend to be blessed times is it better to have Aid prayer very early on a day is it the practice in some countries to have eight prayers and open air so it's a Sunnah to pray out in the open for Aid if the elements allow us you know so if it's snowing outside and it's minus whatever no we're not going to pray outside we'll die so don't this is just if it's the if the weather permits then yeah we can pray outside because that's the Sunnah uh I think last we prayed inside because it was raining because the weather didn't permit and and so on and so forth so again these things are with the compatibility of the physical elements as far as the uh I eat time being early what is the time of the aid prayer right the time of day prayer is after the sun rises the sherook until before so that's the time that you can pray I eat so because of that most uh in many Muslim countries right when the Sun rises that's when they do David prayer I personally prefer that because it you know you get up and you go to it and so on and so forth I know as Society changes and as people's personal and daily habits change people seem to prefer the later Aid time and and it's it is unfortunate that in many places because the aid prayer is considered early many people will not praise because they're you know been up partying the night before or whatever and they miss it and things like that there's another issue altogether says that's a social issue but the issue is when is it permissible from the time that the sun rises meaning the end of federal prayer before though her prayer that's the time that we can pray Aid and in our mosque we have taken advantage of that and we have provided a little bit of you know cushion of the time to make it appropriate not because people are lazy but because people work then people go to school and things like that so we've tried to find times that we think are compatible with the American daily schedule more or less using the knowledge that we have this range to pray if I vomit accidentally as my fast invalid no the act of vomiting itself doesn't break your fast but if anything comes back into your mouth after it's exited sorry to be disgusting that would break your fast so again excuse me anything that comes into the body cavity that's outside that's what breaks the fast my little kids want to fast half a day should I allow this what do I tell them well for young kids you know this is how we all learned how to fast you have to start out doing something so um fast until and then fast until Assad and then after that fast until so the next several years I mean the next maybe 15 years the the amount of time will be getting earlier and earlier so it will become easier and easier or rather the day will become shorter and shorter the fasting day will be shorter and shorter so it's a good time to have the kids practice but having them practice in this way is fine because it's very hard to go from zero to full fasting without having gone through the through the exercise of I'm going to prevent myself from eating uh you know until the afternoon time so on and so forth so this is a good way to get our kids to practice last week a newly converted Muslim was fatally shot by the police at the Janessa prayer for him many police officers attended what is the ruling and praying and as the prayers of the body is not there we have something called the absent funeral prayer so if uh the body doesn't have to be there to pray the Jenna is that the prophet is he prayed the absent funeral prayer for the najeshi in abyssinia when he passed away so that's fine and there's a spiritual practice that some of the saintly people would pray the absent funeral prayer every day for any Muslim who have who has died that day and no one prayed on before so that's not an issue and there can be multiple funeral prayers for a person so if if a well-known person or a island or something like that passes away in another country it would be custom that many people in different communities would pray the absent prayer if I missed my fast due to my cycle do I need to make it up if so how soon yes you need to make up the prayers uh sorry you need to make up the fasting that the woman misses during her monthly cycle she doesn't obviously have to make up the prayers but she has to make up the fasting and as soon as possible so that the days don't add up now some of the opinions say that it has to be done before the next Ramadan but I take the more liberal approach to make it easier for people uh just do it when you can but you got to do it and schedule it or else they start to add up into into a number that's very large when we pray with her during Ramadan I usually do so soon after today and congregation can I do my witters later the prophet is said that there can be no two with their prayers in one night so if you're at the mosque and you're going to pray with her with us and you know that there's the Dua and the punut of winter and you want to catch that that's good and I advise people to do that and you pray your Wizard and then when you go home you want to pray some more after you pray some more you need to pray two more with us so that the total number of wits in that night is an odd number the shortest or smallest with their prayer is just one raka so if you went home building on the example if you went home and you prayed a little bit more then you would pray one raka salaam salaam one raka salaam and in that way you would have concluded your evening or the total number of odd prayers so that's the solution to that issue that's that's a question that we get almost without doubt every single Ramadan another thing you can do is that when you pray The Witcher prayer with us in the Masjid you can intend because we do two and then one so when you stand to pray that one last raka with with the Imam you can intend that you are praying two cycles of prayer and then after the Imam says you stand and you finish your rock on that way you haven't prayed Salah so in the method it's permissible to have a different intention than the Imam uh in the Sunnah prayers uh it doesn't have to be exactly compatible in that regard uh where am I okay if I pray to hedrut after I go home after tarawiah and having prayed with her at iccp do I have to offer with her again after that's the same the same question so just make sure that the number of winter prayers in the night are an odd number and that's easily solvable by praying two more individual rakas with a Salam after itraka to make your total number of witches throughout the night an odd number because means odd so that that's that's the goal my husband is morally harassing me we have been married for 20 years he does not pray and treats me badly always complaining it's really awful to live in the house what options does a wife have under Islamic law well any type of abuse from a man to a husband a woman a husband to a wife physical abuse verbal abuse emotional abuse Financial abuse and abuse daughter any daughter any abuse is a divorceable offense and that's why Allah has made divorce permissible the most disliked of the permissible acts now I don't know you know based on the question if it's at that level but that's certainly an option another option is that you can have somebody to intervene you can have a neutral party uh to intervene to try to make sure to try to reconcile between them which is usually usually not all the time but usually the go-to answer is well let's try to have a Reconciliation which is what we call kind of call in our modern you know way a type of counseling marital counseling Etc to try to help solve these problems but under no circumstances should any husband be abusive to their wife or vice versa should a wife be abusive to their husband that's Haram Allah says oh son of Adam I have made Injustice against my nature forbidden so therefore do not uh and I have made it for you forbidden so do not be unjust one to another so uh the prophet saws The Best of You are the Best of you to your women folk and I am the best of you to my women folk he also said that be gentle with the fragile ones meaning women and so on and so forth so the the disposition of the man towards the woman in Islam is that the man is supposed to be kind and gentle with the woman not rough and tough so that's something that's very very important and that's something that a lot of our societies have lost but the man tends to be very firm and difficult and so but that's not how the prophet Allah was with women at all and that's the Sunnah that we need to revive anyway so we can reconcile if it doesn't work out there can be divorce uh Etc and if the person who wrote the question wants help they should reach out to us directly and either myself or remember if I would be more than happy and willing to sit down and see what we can do in Sharma I am a diabetic and need to inject insulin will this uh will my fast be valid I really want to observe my fast as we said insulin shots because they're intramuscular do not invalidate the fast that's fine the only thing the type of shot that would inter that would invalidate is the intravenous shock like if you're on an IV or or draw blood or something like that in Ramadan can I pray to Hedgewood soon after tarawiah I need to get some sleep before Vegeta and go to work of course you can pray anytime you want it doesn't have to be at the very end of the day uh it doesn't have to be at the very end of the night whatever works for you is fine at Ramadan our mosque it's very crowded and we have to pray outside if the Imam is inside the mosque and we are in front of him is our prayer valid yes in our mosque we have adopted the position of Imam Malik that the Imam being the first person in the line is not a condition for the congregational prayer in the mental of the Imam of Medina and because of the necessity that we have of course that's a his his position not shared by the other but in this case this is a position that we we adopt uh out of necessity because as I mentioned we have we're confined by certain space and um building requirements Etc and the way that our property is subhanallah I mean it's a blessing that when you walk into the building the Qibla is the way it is and it works with the the house I mean that in itself is like a Divine sign the the fact that we don't have an odd Qibla but at the same time you know the house has its capacity so the people that are outside in the way that the property is in its Hills and so on and so forth is that oftentimes the people that pray the the Overflow are in front of the Imam so out of necessity we've adopted that position and the prayer is valid inshallah in Ramadan and outside of Ramadan we've just adopted the position in general I mean many times when I'm doing Juma and I stand to pray when I look when I look out the window next door the Imam prays they'll be people downstairs or outside that are in front of me uh out of necessity right so that's fine inshallah is there a particular month when it's better to get married in some communities they avoid the amount of Ramadan and most weddings are often after the month of Hajj because because I mean Ramadan it's hard to have the wedding right because we're doing something else which is fasting and things like that and that would put you know a burden on the couple because they're also going to be fasting and have to be show restraint even though it's a time of happiness and and you know they will engage in in activities with one another so and then hides because people travel for Hajj so it's just like a maybe a Muslim cultural thing that those ones would tend to be avoided so I think it's more about scheduling but my advice in general is that when one can get married to get married and not to delay that unnecessarily can you speak to the various categories of zakaya so that we could be guided this Ramadan also the fitra if I were to spend to give a young lady in mayor if I sorry if I were to spend to give a young lady in marriage Say by way of giving the Dowry will it qualify as zika okay the zakat verse is the verse in Surat at tauba which enumerates uh for us the categories of the eight categories of zakat so Allah says [Music] those are the eight categories so the poor and the needy are two different categories they give different opinions uh different definitions of of them but the standard definition is that the fakir is better has more than the machine the poor needs a hundred every month and they have 80 the mesquine needs 180 a month every month and they have 20. so it's it's they're both below the threshold of what they need but in varying degrees so those are two categories is not something that takes place once in the year at the same time for everybody everybody has their own calendar because the minute you come into possession of zakatable wealth and money you begin counting the year from when you take possession so therefore throughout the year at any given day any given week people will be paying out there's a cash so those that distribute the zakats a full-time job because there's also zucchin livestock there's also this account on fruits it's not just gold and silver and money so people that have I mean in in our community I mean not that I know of I don't think we have any Farmers but people that have certain type of livestock or our fruit have certain types of fruits they're going to take some of that and give it to their cat and then people that are Traders people that trade on items they buy item a and they and they sell item a unprocessed they trade it those people also have to pay zakat on those trade items so therefore all throughout the year there will be people paying zakat so there has to be a set of people whose responsibilities to collect that and distribute that so those people themselves they can take they can be paid their salary from this account those whose hearts are to be reconciled these are different groups of Muslims these are not non-muslims because zacchais cannot be paid to non-muslims but these are groups of Muslims whose Hearts need to be reconciled such as somebody who has become Muslim but their Iman is weak and supporting them financially will help them or somebody who has converted to Islam their Iman is sound but they are a prominent person in their community so giving them their that wealth would be a way of increasing Goodwill or the dawa Etc or so there are four subcategories the third one is a group of people a group of Muslims who's supporting them financially would help ward off a neighboring enemy in other words it would offset the necessity of the state to raise an army to fight the enemy and related to that the fourth category is supporting a group of Muslims who are placed physically strategically Etc to fight with those who have prevented paying the zakat and by offsetting the balance sheet of the state supporting them would be easier than the state fighting them and those four subcategories are you you won't find those in normal books of flip you kind of have to search the longer books those who are in in in bondage who are purchasing their freedom those who are in debt because they can take from the zakah we can pay those who are in debt to get out of their debt is is traditionally understood as Jihad fisa a type of struggle legitimate struggle that for the Jihad to be a true Jihad it has to be it has to be under a political Banner the prophet saws said in other words it's not this like vigilante stuff it has to be a formal declaration of war by a duly constituted State and it has to be solely for the purpose of of defending the faith not we're camouflaging what we really want to do and saying we're defending the Faith No it's like our faith is being attacked brothers and sisters are being persecuted just because they say and therefore we're going to support them which is and I say that because I mean we don't have those type of conflicts much anymore you know unless we're going to go free people that are being persecuted you know because they're being ethnically cleansed because they're Muslim or something like that but um that's the condition for it to be precipated at now some of the salaf argued by arms or can it be done through and listen can it be done through the tongue in other words is there another type of form of jihad other than armed conflict said yes it can also be bill lisen why is that important because in the modern condition many people will ask and I think it's one of the questions that will come later many people will ask can you give zakat to the mosque now if you see so far all of the categories these are all people you can't give zakat to Brick and Mortar it has to be to people the prophet saws to take money from the wealthy and distribute it to the poor but take it from people and give it to people that need it so some of the modern element will argue now this is a position I have to be fair that I do not follow myself but it is a position that's there and the mosque has chosen to follow it which is its right to follow and this is an issue of HD head uh and you know so on and so forth they will argue that a mosque in a non-muslim community that provides vital services in other words without the existence of this mosque there would be no way for Muslims to learn their Deen so on and so forth that is a form of jihad fisa which is true I mean that I'm not going to argue with and therefore they will say based on that you can give your zakat to the mosque Pizza the person who was traveling who was stuck from traveling and needs money to get to their destination okay so those are the categories of the of the zakat uh the target is that we we give to at least three of those categories if we can now some of these categories we're not going to find like we're not going to find people in bondage alhamdulillah well I hope we don't find people in bondage and things like that um but we tried to give to at least three categories now the questioner let me just find the question again but the questioner said something about a dowry Etc but no that wouldn't count uh if you're getting married you can't give your wife her Dowry based on the zakaya because that's an obligation of the marriage contract uh uh yeah okay when it comes to zakatul fit the cattle fitter is something else is obligatory for each one of us old and young man and woman that needs to be paid before salaheed the first of all which is the day of its obligation that's what it needs to be paid by the latest it's permissible to pay the Catholic from the very beginning of Ramadan and every Ramadan I say this my advice for myself and for you is that the first night of Ramadan you go to the mosque for today and tomorrow is the first day of fasting players the captain fits right then and there so you don't forget what is the cat would fit it's a saw it's one two kilograms of food staple foods of that region stable foods are different types of food wheat grain nuts beans whatever the stable rice all of those have different prices so we approximate the price we say like 12 to 15 dollars per person basically that's where we get the number from and why am I saying paid in the first of Ramadan so we have a chance to distribute it to the people that need it but if you if you come and you give it to me and I'm about to stand and give the foreign I'm not going to be able to distribute it before I start to you've maybe checked the box that you've done your obligation but we've also not having a chance to give it to the person who needs it so my suggestion is that we all of us make it as like a personal Sunnah personal custom that when we go to the first Ramadan first tarawih of our Ramadan might be the first second third night whatever we take with us the money for zakatul fit and we put it in the zakata Fitz box so that's a different type of zakat okay as our moss in the U.S are not supported by the government can I contribute my zakat to the mosque so that they can promote Islam as I said as long as the mosque is providing vital services which obviously all months are supposed to but you know what I mean in other words we can make an argument that you know without this mosque my kids can't learn Islam they're not going to learn how to pray the basics the furud then according to that opinion of the salaf uh that would be permissible and that is the position that the mosque has adopted can I use the cab funds to support scholarships no now we're getting off into the off the Beaten Track it has to be for the categories that we we mentioned okay Montgomery County Public Schools has approved a selection of lgbtq inclusive texts to be read in the classroom in elementary schools they are not offering any forms of options to parents to see if they want to opt out their children to be part of these readings like they offer options to opt out to teach Family Planning how do you think we should respond to this or what steps can we take as a Muslim Community to see if we can get the option to opt out I am as a parent very disturbed by it resist that's what we need to do we need to resist we need to apply pressure we need to speak we need to find other like-minded communities that are not necessarily Muslim communities but other religious communities because that's um that's problematic on so many levels because they are trying to teach our children something that is outside the confines of logic that's that's the problem with it it's not that it's not that there are um has nothing to do about respecting other people we respect all people uh and and our mosque is open for all people that's different but you can't come and tell me that one plus one is no longer two and you can't come and tell me that I'm no longer a man uh I might be a woman or There are 16 other genders there is not there's only two genders says specifically in the Quran subhanallah I have created the two genders male and female so I mean that that's beyond the confines of simple logic if somebody came uh to try to teach us um uh maybe we can find another example that's just so crazy that that it's not controversial but if somebody you know came to teach us uh uh you know that America is the oldest country in the world uh it's 10 000 years old and has a continuous I mean it's just not true that's just not a true fact it's one of the newer countries it was discovered by the discovery of America it's a historical fact this is a biological scientific fact nothing will ever change that nothing will ever change the usage of the English language of he and she of male and female you have thousands you know thousands of years of human language across different languages different language groups with stats established that this is what these words mean you can't come now and change that that's not it doesn't that's not how language Works they will try to change it but you'll need like another 10 000 years of human life to agree to that change for it to actually take place so when it comes to something like this we have to resist we have to resist within the confines of the law we have to resist by making noise we have to resist by applying prayer this is when we need the type of political pressure uh that people wanna people will talk about Muslims getting involved in politics this is one of the things that we need to get involved in go to the county executive or I don't know whatever the head of the mcps and and say we have concerns about this at least there should be an option you know there's an option for the family planning so on and so forth so resist can take resistance can take different types of forms I'm not talking about you know picket signs and and vandalism that's you know that's not useful and and the vandalism part is Haram I'm not talking about that but there needs to be some type of Civil Disobedience and resistance when it comes to that as simple as that don't don't let what's being said at school and publicly change the fact that wrong is wrong when it comes to this issue it's just wrong I'm sorry it's just as simple as that there's nothing that we can we can do about that because it's not it's something Beyond even religion itself it just has to do with human logic now when it comes to the readings I don't know what those books are so I would be interested if somebody can bring me some of those books it'd be nice to look at them but some of those books might just make Illusions might make references might not be as bad as people might think it is I'm talking here about the specific type of books and then that can be dealt with differently by how we read them to our children and how they are discussed but in general when it comes to that kind of stuff my opinion is that we need to resist and it will be uncomfortable and it will be difficult uh but it's one of those things where it's one of those moments where you have to you know stand for the truth and you there'll be other people that are standing for the truth that are also timid to stand for the truth and we need to work in association with them can I listen to the Quran to Quran recitation and recite Victor while breastfeeding or do I need to be covered in a hijab no that's fine you can listen to the Quran there should be nothing that that prevents you from having a relationship with the Quran I work as a psychologist and I'm coming across patients who are identifying as transgender even some Muslim clients I want to do my best sorry I want to do my job and help them emotionally and at the same time I don't want to show support for their trans or gay identity can I still work with these clients or should I refer them out it really depends on what's being asked of you if somebody comes to you with us like they're they have insomnia I'm just making this up they have insomnia but they're gay that's one thing because you're you're addressing the insomnia part but if somebody comes to you because they're gay or transgender and they come from a Muslim family or they identify that they're Muslim and they're coming to you specifically about this issue I'm assuming at some point you're going to come to some kind of ethical conflict between your obligation as a health care provider and your obligation is your personal belief so when you feel that there is that conflict that's when I would say you can refer them out because you know you're not gonna you don't want to lose your license and do something unethical you also swore an oath if you're a physician you know you sworn in the Hippocratic Oath not to do no harm Etc and uh we are a people that follow our O's and our conditions so therefore you know it would be safer in that case to refer them out so it's there's a little bit of subjectivity to it because it depends what the person is coming to you about also this is something that I need to be more educated on I need to know what the latest guidelines are for healthcare providers for dealing with these people I'm assuming that but I'm it's just an assumption I'm assuming that you know you can't make a value judgment I'm assuming that you're going to have to basically validate what they're going through support them in their decisions so it's not really you're not really helping them you're there to be an echo chamber to it's an echo chamber and you're there to facilitate for them well that's different you know that's a that's a different scenario so it depends on which shade of what I'm of this issue that I just mentioned you're finding yourself in but let's abstract a little bit just to ask a general question can I as a Muslim provide a service for a gay person or a transgender person well absolutely of course because we deal with people all the time that don't share our values or our beliefs there's nothing wrong with that the prophet saws dealt with the polytheists I mean it's even worse there can be there's nothing worse than polytheism the prophet says I'm transacted with them so also we're not like the cake people like Yuki I mean you can't get into that I think well I'm never going to talk to a gay person or that's not the or I'm not saying that at all we respect all people and not just that we love all people we the the Allah tells us if you were rough and tough with people they would have left you from Allah Allah Begins the verse by saying by Allah's Mercy you inclined ya rasulullah towards people the prophet saws loved people he never made Dua against the people the people that persecuted him he asked God he asked Allah to guide them so that's the prophetic model also at the same time that shouldn't prevent me from saying what you're doing is wrong so we need to also revive that that dichotomy that we can make that distinction so what I'm saying has nothing to do about how we deal with people with respecting them uh honoring them as a human being so on and so forth but I'm not going to put myself in a position where I'm going to validate when somebody does something wrong someone does something wrong it's wrong just like when I do something wrong you need to tell me I did something wrong so on and so forth okay I think the rest of the questions are a little bit easier according to the Hadith when a man dies his Good Deeds come to an end well not a man anybody except three ongoing charity beneficial knowledge and a righteous child will pray for him then if someone else prays for my descendant deceased father would this benefit him in Bangladesh Bangladeshi culture family members arranged a Dua gathering on the fourth day and a feast on the 40th Day are those beneficial okay oh why does it say only the prayers of a righteous child what about the prayers of a righteous parent or the child even to the the child who's not religious no any any help anybody that's left behind anybody that makes Dua for their brother and sister that have passed that benefits the person in his past without doubt the the prophet saws is just highlighting categories so uh uh you know a Pious descendant uh or a Pious member of the community it's just it's like a category it's not not necessarily verbatim that person as far as uh fourth day 40th Day Etc all of those type of things anything that we do when we come together to honor the person that has passed away by remembering Allah and doing good works in that person's name without doubt benefits that person so these are just cultural manifestations of a truth that we believe in is that death is not the end of life and that when the person dies those that are living that are left we do what we can for them by remembering them making Dua for them reading Quran for them doing charitable Works in their name so on and so forth if I miss any mandatory Salah despite my best effort for example I am not able to wake up in the morning with multiple alarms what should I do well he should try to sleep earlier number one waking up early is a function of sleeping early uh uh so you it's a matter of training the body and to train the body you need to train the body gently okay so you can't just automatically you know snap your fingers and then you're able to do it all but you have to change you have to change your habits slightly towards the goal which in this case should be sleeping early and waking up early um the other thing about waking up early is that you can recite the last three verses of Surah inaudine is [Music] I think it's the last four verses then so the last four verses of Surah and then after you recite those verses to ask Allah to help you get up in time for Frederick as far as what happens if this happens you just pray what you missed you have to pray them is prayers are are prescribed upon us so therefore we have to pray them okay we are practicing Muslim family recently a boy we don't know has expressed interest in our daughter through one of her friends she's in college and so is he by a friend's account and his own he prays and fast my husband and I are unsure of how to proceed but what to tell our daughter if they meet at a cafe for instance should a third person be with them what should the parameters be any advice on how to proceed would be much appreciated what are the steps to engaging in a Muslim marriage is it talking then fed to engagement then engagement then wedding and full marriage During the fatah period what does this mean for the couple can they go out alone in public places like restaurants museums and cafes well first of all uh you need to involve uh the other the the boy's parents if they're in if if it's genuine interest so that adds a little bit of you know a level of responsibility because like let's say you ask to meet the parents or something like that or they want to come and then you know it doesn't happen or he keeps giving excuses so maybe he's just expressing his own feelings which are probably genuine and natural but he has no way of backing them up so I would try to look at that as far as the parameters until people do the kitab until people do the actual ceremony they're not married so even when they're engaged there can be no physical touch they can't be alone you know there can't be no intimacy Etc all of that would be Haram because they're still not married which is why I recommend that the engagement period not be prolonged unnecessarily you know you hear stories when people are engaged for years years plural that's like a you know that's just like it's almost like a form of torture I mean you know just just get married so the the process would be the engagement is a type of we are making this announcement so that people know that we are talking about marriage and that the girl is engaged so somebody else can't come and engage her so the prophet saws told us that we can't do that we can't a man can't go and seek an engagement of a woman who's already in English were called betrothed you know somebody who's promised to somebody else but there's no legal obligation other than that in the engagement period but the point of the engagement is that that you you know they're going to visit each other in the home you know they can't be alone you know the parents are going to be involved or older siblings or something like that and they're talking about the marriage process they're making arrangements they're setting a date they're talking about what where they're going to live how they're going to live so on the Dowry all of that kind of stuff and once all of that stuff takes place then you do the kitab once you do the kitab you're married hold on that's the marriage because how do you undo the kitab you undo the kitab through divorce right so that means that it's a marriage it's a full marriage and usually with the kitab there's a type of walima or a type of you know Gathering of people so that's that's what Islam says now culture says something completely different you know there can be all or not it's completely different but there can be all sorts of these cultural I I see them as false impositions they're just unnecessarily impose that make things more complicated and now you've heard me talk about this this is one of my personal pet peeves I do not hold to that at all uh and I like to stick more to what our religion teaches because I think it's simpler and easier of course we should have fun and of course we need to celebrate and we call al-farah you know it's a it's a joyous occasion without doubt but I'm I'm all about making it easier for people I don't want people to be frustrated by it so anyway my advice is to talk to your daughter seriously because this is a serious thing and she needs to know the rights what the do's and the don'ts and try to see if the the boy's parents are interested to meet then that will tell you the level of seriousness just a couple more questions and I know that people might have some comments or questions Etc my daughter 11 asked me why did the earthquake happen is Allah punishing the bad people so I said no it is a reminder from Allah about his power and that we need to return to Allah and so we asked why did children die I said that every human has a set time to live I don't know if this was convincing or even if I said the right thing can you please elaborate on this topic so you have to understand to understand these type of calamities we also have to understand how they relate to the hereafter so these people that you know is a tragedy of of the largest proportions I mean there's no no it's a you know the the the heart uh cries for those images and I think there was just an earthquake yesterday another earthquake yesterday I think in almost the same region and then you think about the criminality of the people that violate the building codes and all these buildings that easily collapse on and so forth there are many signs in this one of them is as you said it's a sign of Allah's Powers one of the signs is one of the signs of Yemen that there'll be an increase of earthquake and natural calamities but however we also have to remember that those people who have died have you know been guaranteed their place in Paradise and as I said before when we when we go when we die the time that we experience when we die compared to the time that we experience now every minute we experience after death will be 33 years of our human life so our whole life will be no more than two to three minutes that's it so like think about it when you dream when you dream and you're in the dream you might have this like Vivid dream and and at the moment of the dream it feels like this very elaborate thing and then you wake up but actually that actual dream that you just had took a couple of seconds or a couple of moments so even in our own life now we can experience this relativity that I'm talking about of time so yes it's a tragedy it's horrible we need to help them we need to pray for them the people that have you know that that are a cause of those buildings to to crumble like you know Buckle like that need to be uh pursued Etc but at the same time let us not forget that these people will be saved the prophet saws mentioned some type of Calamity of this large scale and he said to say that you know many many people will die men and women and children and she said all of them are going to die at rasulullah and then he said yes but all of them will be resurrected human claima based on their intention so the people that are good that this will be a cause of their entrance into Paradise so we don't want to forget that aspect of it as well at the same time we don't want what I'm saying to make us this you know uh uh not act no we do need to act on a human level in any way that we can last question if one is making up Vegeta after the sunrise prayer has come up can you still pray that Sunnah before the father of the prayer yes and if you miss come in in what order should you pray oh sorry if you missed an Asana has come in in what order should you pray it if you can pray the Lord first and then answer but if you walk into the Masjid and we're praying Asana if you follow the method you can just follow have a different intention than the Imam if not then you're going to pray awesome and then pray the Lord after that and that would be one of those weird situations in which the prayers will be reversed but in the default is if you can pray them in order pray them in order foreign [Music] does brushing your teeth break your fast no as long as you do not swallow the water um so don't swallow the water and when you rinse make sure that you spit everything out just like you would in prayer I mean just like you would in wudu miss the reading sessions as well shanaz I don't know what that means do you have is that something to me or were you writing to somebody else yeah it was just a comment about the readings you know when they have scheduled the readings of the books that we were talking about so as you said Civil Disobedience would that would that's what I would I I just wanted to say that that one could just so the mcps question yeah yeah yeah well uh but by the way I mean I need to I would I really do want to see those books so if somebody would be kind enough to drop some off at the mosque inshallah I'll be back shortly I would like to look at them so that my comments are more accurate is it better to read the entire Quran during Ramadan or prayer in congregation followed by tarawiah I would do both but I asked due to time constraints it's better to read the Quran if you in that dichotomy it would be better to read the Quran because it's the month of the Quran and the recitation of the Quran is a great a great benefit but if what I'm saying if you end up doing that and you feel like alone right because I guess that means we wouldn't see you in in tarawea which would be sad then and you feel lonely than coming to pray to be better because then you're with the group so it depends about your disposition I like for example I remember uh when I was um finishing my thesis at Princeton uh and there were several several of I mean took several years but there were several of those ramadans at iccp in the early years at iccp I was still finishing my thesis and I remember it might have been like the first or second Ramadan iccp I was in that situation I I mean I I just I had to write and I could I could only write at night and it was just this enormous academic task and I and I uh I was not able to come to Toro I think I came just once when I was asked to every now and again but other than that I was at home doing my thing writing finishing my thesis and then I would read my juice uh for the day um so I I've been in that situation but but I was preoccupied with the task so I didn't have a chance to feel alone but if you end up feeling like I I know I miss the the you know the Ambiance and stuff then come to the most regarding the earlier question that came in during uh sorry whoa oh the engagement period does another person need to be with the couple when they meet is prohibited for a man and a woman means that a man and a woman are alone in a place in which no other person is expected so um I mean maybe some of my examples will date me but like if you met at an Eatery in a mall well I mean that's a public place it's not you don't think of that as a private place right but a few men in a hotel room that's you're not expecting anyone right you put the do not disturb a sign or or button or light or whatever so the khalwa is when we other people are not expected so if I'm home alone and a girl comes over that would be inappropriate because I mean I I hope somebody from my family will show up but I'm alone at that moment and then you know we're in confined in the door it can be closed and so on and so forth so it depends on that so the same for option in that situation is yes that they should be in a public place or they should be at each other's homes uh under the auspices of the family that's how that's what I would say is medical malpractice lawsuit permissible meaning you want to sue a doctor because of malpractice I mean that's if somebody if a doctor harms you then you have the right to seek legal recourse or you are a medical professional and you need malpractice insurance that's also permissible because if you don't have that you're going to die if you get sued by the person who's always coming in with a neck brace you know and claiming that you did it so it depends on which side you are you're on but yeah I mean but don't go around suing people just just to try to take money you know like an ambulance Chaser but obviously I don't think the person asking the question means that but yes I mean if if somebody has harmed you in a procedure and and and not provided the right care then you you have the right to pursue that and I almost guarantee you that that person has malpractice insurance to be able to cover that what questions would you recommend someone ask a boy who is seeking or talking about marriage well you know there are things that you ask directly and then there are things that you understand indirectly so if you ask a person you know don't ask a person are you a good Muslim or something like that I mean that's you have to determine that from from how they conduct themselves but you know what are you studying what do you want to do um you know how do you plan to support uh our daughter because there is a financial component that's what the Dowry is about to be able to establish that Financial component so you need to kind of put structure to that kind of it's not just emotions he's entering it emotionally she's entering it emotionally but you as the parent you know we as parents we need to we want to understand what do you plan to do in the next you know immediate steps of course risk belongs to Allah anything and everything can happen but especially because the person asked the question mentioned that they're in college well if you're in college that means you know you're still in the very very beginning of your life so what what you what are you studying uh what kind of jobs are you looking for where do you see where do you want to live um you know things like that those are the type of questions you need to see that the the boy is ready to assume responsibility financial responsibility and also emotional responsibility and to uh to make sure that that they're ready all of them all those parts they're ready to handle that a lot of times people want to get married and they at that young age and they are thinking purely from the physical sexual component you know someone is a a girl has awoken that inside them they get very excited they want to do the right thing so they're like let's get married okay which is good I mean that's a good thing by the way but at the same time they need to also know what there's you know what do you plan to do about children when you're very young what do you plan how are you going to support your wife what are you studying what kind of employment are you looking for so on and so forth that's what I would ask also I was I wanted to remind everyone that tomorrow's halaka with Imam refai will be online because I think remember if I is is out of town for the day so he will conduct on Zoom any other questions uh just to con yeah just to comment uh Tariq um at the last count between last Ramadan and today uh you have on third almost 600 questions this might uh come as a surprise but surprise me I mean I'll bless you uh and also you bless Imam refi because between the two of you you cover a lot of ground but I might also say that today we had almost uh for 50 14 45 questions and many sub questions all in preparation for Ramadan and we will invite the community to send in any other questions prior to Ramadan and if there is a substantial amount of questions then we might uh Prevail on you and Imam refi to do even a joint session to answer a pre Ramadan just two or three days before to to help people to understand and appreciate the issues that come with Ramadan we are in the customer serving business service business so we want our customers to be able to to have their advice as needed uh having said all that may Allah bless you and your family the reader and the children for your dedication I mean yeah that's a good idea happy to do that a few days before Ramadan I have no problem with that what so it might be a good thing to do there were a lot of as you mentioned fasting related questions but as we come closer there might be more I'm happy uh to to do that inshallah and uh wow 600 quests over 600 that's that's I was not expecting that number but alhamdulillah we asked Allah to give us the strength and the fortitude to keep going to increase us in our faith in our practice we ask Allah to bless us in this month of Shaban may we arrive all of us together safely in the month of Ramadan we ask Allah to accept our prayers and our fasting our devotional works we ask Allah to protect our children to have mercy on our parents to forgive those who have passed before us we ask Allah to protect us from all harm and to protect our community and to protect our homes and our businesses and our schools and we know that Allah is over all things [Music] [Music] I'll see you all Friday in sha'allah take care of
