the first question is why is magic haram that means what is the reason behind it what is the reason behind allah making it something forbidden for us to engage in first of all there's a difference of opinion inside the family of islam as to what magic is exactly as sunnis we believe that magic is something that is is real it can actually uh it actually has an effect the matasolites which were a fringe or a non-orthodox school of theology which really no longer exist they believe that it was not necessarily real but it's something that that appears to be its effects appear to be real but that effect that you that you see is not actually real and it goes back to a difference of tafsir of some of the verses dealing with magic particularly in the story of moses but as soon as we believe that it's real magic actually exists and it can't have effect but it's actually very weak in naked shaytani for the powers and the ability and the machinations rather is a better translation the machinations of shaitaan are weak so our belief is yes it is it does exist it can happen but its effects are weak so why is it haram for us to deal with it because when allah describes magic in surat al-baqarah he says and learning magic etcetera and the quran and the the story of sidney sullivan he says that they learn what harms them and what harms other people not what benefits them so the reason why magic is haram it's haram to engage in it is because it is something that its ultimate goal is to harm it causes heart you know no one is going to do magic for something good to happen it's not like a movie you know when people practice magic or sometimes we translate it as black magic they do it with the intention of harming someone and obviously that's haram there's no harming or reciprocating harm magic they end up focusing or they end up relying on other than allah and for us our reminder constantly is that there is no power or ability except why are certain foods haram certain foods are haram due to allah's wisdom allah has revealed that certain things behind there's not necessarily a rational explanation why we don't eat pork or why we don't eat the dog or you know et cetera et cetera other than to remind us that there is a spiritual link between what we eat and our relationship with allah subhana wa so it's as if allah is telling us that there is something divine in the issue of food we are meant to eat that we are meant to eat food that is it's legally permissible but it's also taiya but it's also good and then in many instances the prophet saw taught us that what we eat what we consume what we drink what we wear affects us our heart affects our heart our fix our relationship with allah subhana wa like in the hadith with the man is traveling and he extends his hands to allah and he says he's asking allah so outwardly you know he's he's a traveler he's in need he's he's asking allah but then the prophet salallahu but rather this person's food is haram their drink is harm their clothes are haram they are nourished by the haram how is it that allah will accept from this person so in that hadith and in other hadith the prophet sasalam is telling us what we eat what we consume affects our relationship with allah subhana wa so when we find that kind of pattern then we are reminded that it is out of allah's wisdom it's something that is revealed from the divine and there's no necessarily there's not necessarily a rational explanation and sometimes that's just the answer in other words uh it doesn't mean that there is no answer i'm trying to impress upon us that that is the answer we call this in in the study of of we call we say that the reason is the reason is that we do it out of worship meaning that there's no reason there's no rational reason why but rather we do it out of obedience to allah to remind us that this is a religion that this is a religious tradition this is not some kind of philosophical or rational science why is smoking haram well the issue of smoking is something that has progressed legally in islamic history because when it first appeared it was something new and and there were you know a whole host of different opinions you know people said that it was haram people said that it was people said that it was mubarak some you know minor people even said it was it was encouraged but as the harm of smoking became more established the people the ulam that opined that it is haram and that's today the majority of allah they say that is haram because of its established harm and the prophet salallahu he said there is no harming and there is no reciprocating harm i'm sorry just somebody's mic is on so i feel like i'm going to yell over it um if if everyone can just turn off the mic i'm gonna see if i can find that person okay i think it's gone just a reminder for everyone to keep make sure that their mic is is off oh i don't have the ability to mute uh okay anyway so the majority of people today the majority of the majority of mufti's today they say that smoking is haram because it's it's harm is established it's harm health wise etc there is a minority of people that say it's it's disliked it's simply because the harm is is different you know a 15 year old smoking is not like a you know 80 year old coveted patient smoking i mean the effect the harm on each person will be will be different but the majority of people they say that it is haram because of its harm it's harm health-wise which is essentially an established scientific fact what if we are following the wrong religion so this is a bigger question i'm just going to i want to mark what i've done so i don't repeat another way of phrasing this is how do we know we are right or how do we know or how have we come to know what we know and believe it or not this was a question that the early muslims asked themselves to ask themselves how do we know that what we have is the quran and how do we know that what we have is the sunnah or the hadith of the prophet sallallahu alaihi and because of this question there is a a huge movement intellectual scholarly movement you know from the time of the sahaba till our time for for for verification and islam is very concerned and very obsessed with this issue of verifying how do we verify that we have the quran that we have is the quran how do we verify that the hadith we have is the hadith of the prophet through a very sophisticated system of verification and analyzing chains of transmission and uh uh establishing that all of the links in the chain of transmission that these people are actually real and they actually met and they had good memories and they were known members of society the other man from the earliest generation established without any doubt uh whatsoever that the quran that we have is the quran and then the sunnah that we have is the sunnah is the sayings and the acts and the and the actions of the prophet and because of that we have a huge degree of confidence that what we have is real in other words that there is no human agency that could have protected the quran allah says in and we alone will protect it so it's not through human agency that this happened but the effort of verification simply allowed us to see how this verse has played out and there's nothing that has been protected in human history like like the quran there is no there is no divine book or revealed book or revealed tradition that has that kind of protection that has no discrepancy or no one's ever found a missing missing surah a missing verse etc same with the hadith of the prophet so that's how we verify what we have and the early muslims when they ask that question how do we know that this is really our you know our religion it was that they answered it by engaging in that you know system of verification but if the person is asking the question how do we know that our religion is right or how do we know what if we are following the wrong religions is how the question came to me this also might have to do with faith amen and amen is something that that comes into the heart i can't make that for you but each person has to be on their own journey to arrive at that certainty arrive at that belief when the arab tribes first became muslim allah says in the quran the arab tribe said that we believe don't say you have believed but rather say you have become muslim you have entered into islam because faith has not entered into your heart yet the reason we believe that there is no compulsion in religion is that faith is something that each person has to arrive at and has to make the effort to arrive at i can give you i can try to answer some of the questions that we do in this forum every month but at the end of the day the point of these questions is not to make you believe the point of these questions is to answer these questions and to shed light on them and to share the as much as i can of the scholarly tradition with you so that you can understand the um the the deep thinking and great extent that the people before us uh had and gave towards understanding the quran and the sunnah but still at the end of the day belief is something that it comes down to you individually to arrive at that at that certainty for me the way i look at this question as i began with the with the answer is i looked at how the early muslims answered that question for themselves that they saw the revelation in front of them that they were they verified it that they maintained it and that they found it to that that preservation to last you know through the ages i mean we still have the quran al hamdulillah we still have the sunna so think up think about that what are the methods that can help us pray on time and avoid feeling tired or lazy and postpone it well one tactic is that if people are having difficulty with the prayer is that they can combine zuhra anasa prayer in either time of the horse so either when the time comes in you pray four raka's of lord and then you stand and you pray four raka's or you delay and when assad time comes in you pray the four of duhr and the four of assad and the same with merchrib and ashe so when you add vegetables to that you are essentially praying the five prayers in three times during the day so for people that are are having difficulty and because we are in the west that this is a dispensation that we have and then this comes from the uh from this is the shaft position of the permissibility of combining the prayers uh without reason of illness or or travel or inclement weather which are the normal uh circumstances for combining the prayers and in this way the prayer becomes easier it becomes an easier target the other thing is you know you should have a some kind of a then app on your phone and you should you know have it ring for you when the prayer time comes in in other words a way to to reinforce that that you know or to help have that reminder that okay now is the time to pray you want to also think about scheduling it okay i'm going to pray my duharas combination at this time you know and put it in your calendar and remind yourself maybe you put it in your phone maybe you remind yourself the other thing is to you know maybe those are more like certain strategies and tactics but the other thing to think about is think about why you're praying and why that's important and the implications of not praying the implications of not praying you know god forbid are very severe that this is considered a major sin that the first thing that we will be asked about is our prayer if our prayer is sound insha allah all of our other deeds will be sound if our prayer is in trouble then we'll be in trouble you know may allah protect us so to think about the implications of that in the hereafter and term to remind yourself that this life that we have is very limited you know we're only going to live here in x amount of years um and then we're going to be asked about about what we have done we're going to be asked about what we have been given and allah asks very little of us in return for all of the immense gifts and bounties that he has has given us so you have to think about those other meanings and you have to to move beyond just the here and now and the laziness and think okay this is a great you know a great thing that i must do and it has great reward or great punishment associated with its act or or non-act and therefore inshallah that will help push you forward to pray is it safer or better to raise our teenage girls and muslim countries than the u.s especially with no family here that's not a clear-cut situation because everybody's situation is different i know many people in the muslim world unfortunately who have lost or are losing their faith just like i know many people know us that you know have lost or are losing their faith so it's not it's not a there's no one place that's better or safer than the other as a place but rather it's each person's circumstance the person in the question they say that they have no family so therefore we need to make sure that we have a community and as a matter of fact for people that are from a muslim majority country in a muslim majority family often times that extended family is not necessarily a help sorry sometimes that extended family is not a help in these matters and it could be more of a harm so again it's it depends on everybody's simple dynamic but what's important is that you surround yourself with some kind of community some kind of a support group that will support the values and the ethics that you believe in which is why our community you know is is paramount it's so important because our community is our family uh the fact that we you know for one almost one whole year for one whole year we've been meeting like this uh consistently i mean look how many people right now there are 60 people signed in right and i assume there's at least two to three people on each uh you know each sign-in you know so there are several hundred people about one whole year we've been doing this why have we been doing this because it's important that we stay connected it's important that we we are a family we are all one family and that's what's important is having that community uh it's not about being here or there uh as a matter of fact you know think about all of the prophets you know how they were sent they were sent you know to like no man's land right the prophets were sent to people that were troubled the people that didn't believe that people but they were prophets you know they were protected they were the community uh think about the sahaba after the passing of the prophet saw how they sort of left arabia you know many went east to persia many went west you know ayub and ansari uh radhiallawan was buried in istanbul and in the european part you know he's a sahaba you know these people were very far from home but they carried that mission and they carry that connection with them so it's not about location it's about your state your spiritual state and what will help your spiritual state is your sohbah is your community is the companionship that you keep um for some people it might be better that they they take their family you know back to their home country for some people that will be the the biggest mistake so i don't want people to think about oh you know being in the west that's unnecessarily bad no that's not the case we enjoy many many freedoms and many many luxuries and many many opportunities islamically in the west that we do not exist in many parts of the muslim majority country so it's the community it's having that support group that community and having the people in the community that can help guide the community spiritually and religiously and uh and can help answer people's questions and and you know especially when there are difficult issues that's what matters if you have that insha allah then you have what you need imam al-mawardi who is a very famous khadi of the shafai madhhab you know he's very famous for writing the the rules of govern islamic governorship but he's also you know he has a huge uh literature a huge body of of work in the chef in phil he said that if you have uh your own community and if you have you you know you can pray your five prayers and you can you have access to halal food and you can marry according to the sharia and you can bury your dead and you know if you have those basic things then that for you is islam even if that is in a non-muslim land and i remember reading that you know you know i think i came across that quote as a graduate student and that that was a huge uh paradigm shift for me to to to realize you know what he's saying what i've just answered is essentially what he was saying which is that if you have the basic things that you need to practice your islam that's your abode of islam that's what you need sometimes you don't have that in a muslim majority country sometimes you don't have that in a as a minority and vice versa so it's not about east versus west but it's about having that infrastructure i have a place where i can pray i have a place where i can do ramadan as a community and i have access to juma i have access to someone who can answer my questions there are other families that that want the same things that i want so therefore that our our children can grow up in that environment together etc that's that's what we're after inshallah how can we help our teens or encourage them to pray the five daily prayers i mean if somebody has you know is entering into their teenage years not praying unfortunately that's going to be an uphill battle and that's why prayer is so important that we teach our children at the youngest age possible first of all that they see us praying that we pray together in the house uh and that they learned from a very young age that this is an essential part of their existence this is not like a a weird thing or an extra thing or we pray you know only on friday or only on the weekends but we pray every day and again the the the issue of being able to combine your prayers is something that will help tremendously you know especially kids that are going to school whether it be in winter time or in summer time when we're you know in the spring when we change the clock forward the day is longer the day is shorter this issue of combining the prayers will save a lot of a lot of trouble of having to figure out how to pray at school and you can delay and pray at home and and things like that if if you haven't been doing that and your kids you know you find your kids are 14 15 16 and not praying you know it's very hard to get them to just to start out you know for no reason so unfortunately that's not you know there's not much you're going to be able to do uh the the meta issue here is having to impress upon them the importance of that connection that their day-to-day life if it's devoid of that connection of that spiritual connection then it is going to slowly be devoid of that type of protection and because most teenagers don't think like that that might be lost upon them but you have to just get them to to be responsible for their own lives and that this is important that this is an important part you know live your life do your you know do what you want to do hang out with your friends have a good time all that kind of stuff but you have to have that kind of connection there has to be that kind of of balance you have to find a way to communicate that that message to to those to your children but as i said you need to do this the earlier the better and not to wait and this is a reminder for all of us that we need to be you know praying at home and praying with our children and our families where our prophet sasan's parents grandparents and uncle the believers of abrahamic monotheism i mean to ask what was the religion yeah all of the parents all of the parents and grandparents etc of the prophet isaiah i'm going all the way back to the beginning of creation they were all monotheists this is the one of the meanings of the verse and that we have caused you to transfer from one pious person a sajid the person that makes sujud from one pious person to the next pious person so this is the the belief of adolescent that all of the uh family the the parents the direct parents uh said abdullah and say that going all the way back these are all people that were saved that's for the uncle of the prophet isaiah there's a difference of opinion uh whether he was saved you know whether he said the kalima well one of the uncles whether he uh said the kalima or not and we follow the opinion that he said the kalima out of our love for the prophet isalam because there's no you know fictity issue based on that it's just a it's just a belief but yes they were all monotheists how could we be good and dutiful to our parents when they are not with us in this country you know connect with them call them ask about them uh if they need something that provide it for them if you know if it's a remittance that you're sending back or if it's a service that you help them procure you know now with technology we're able to to be in touch with them ask about them uh you know one of the greatest challenges in older age you know people that are older is loneliness um so we have to be dutiful to our parents whether they are alive or not this is something that is that is upon us until the you know until the day we die and that's important that we remember that you know we're not an out of sight out of mind people just because my parents are not here doesn't mean that i don't owe them something or i don't have to ask about them no we have to ask about them we have to check in on them that's very very important so check in pick up the phone or send a message ask call i remember when we were younger it's just a memory that just popped into my head you know before all of this technology my mom used to we had like a tape recorder that could record so we put like a blank cassette tape in the tape recorder and she would record me and my brother you know would like read like surah al-fattah or then we would like in our broken arabic would say oh you know no no grandma we miss you or like i learned a new piece on the piano so i would play the piece and so my mom over the weeks would just make like these little audio clips on this cassette tape uh for my grandma which you know her mother allah a lot of mercy on her and when she would go or you know somebody from you know our family or friends would visit cairo they would take that tape with with them so can you imagine my my grandma's uh you know i never thought about this but can you imagine her reaction you know sitting there for like an hour listening to this weird audio mix of her grandkids uh must have brought her tremendous joy so you know if you have to find a way to stay in the picture you have to find a way to communicate you have to find a way to ask ask about now we can we have so it's so easy for us to do that now with technology so this is one of the benefits of that what is the ruling of shaking hands between men and women so shaking hands between men and women was not something or not some it was not something that was common practice at the time of the salaf this is a new a new thing a very western a western thing now the way that our legal system works is that whenever there is something that deals with men and women the automatic answer is that it is haram unless there is something that proves otherwise this is an usuli principle that if there's anything if anyone were to ask a question that deals with a man and a woman the automatic answer is that it's going to be haram unless there's a text that proves otherwise which is the opposite of new things all new things are accepted until there is a text or until there's something that is established that makes it uh that would make it haram so this is a one of the rules of islamic law so for many for for a long time or if you ask many people they'll say oh you know men and women shaking hands is haram why it's because of this this rule but is there a prohibition is there a text is there an actual hadith that is that is authenticated that can be used as a proof text those who who investigated this issue found that there is no hadith that is sound there are hadith that are that are there uh that people use to to talk about you know it's impermissible for a man to touch a woman etc and then when the lame of hadith investigated those hadith they found them to be too weak to rely on for a ruling so the position that i follow is that it is not haram for a man to shake hands with a woman however i do acknowledge that at times it would be inappropriate uh it would be an appropriate like in the mosque you know or in a gathering you know at our message it's just not something that we do it's not something that is part of the culture of of islam um again it's not a haram thing it's just not the way we i mean definitely now with covet and stuff like that we're going back to no one wants to shake anyone's hands but you know when you're out in your uh normal life or in a family gathering or in a work gathering and there's a shaking hands that there's nothing there's nothing haram with that uh for the people that you know that have investigated these are reliable allah i know like for me i remember reading sheikh mohammed zakir din ibrahim was a famous sheikh azadi sheikh who died in the 90s 1990s and you know he argued you know the same argument that i'm giving he you know he's the one that put this argument together one of the people i know that put the argument together and looked into the proof text is making dua only permissible during salat al-fajr no you can make in any prayer if there's a nezada if there's a problem or a crisis which would it would be the dua in the last raqqa of the prayer how to overcome get rid of panic attacks during flights or while driving well if this is a spiritual problem then you should learn and memorize the dua of travel subhanallah till the end of it and see if that helps and see if that comforts you if the if that continues and this is not a spiritual problem but this is something that you need to see a healthcare professional or physician to help with anxiety because there might be a chemical imbalance so not all of these things are you know just say this dua and everything is going to be fine sometimes you need to go to the to the physician how to correct my husband while praying if he missed something so the woman when her hands are together like this she she claps like this to indicate that something is wrong being a female i miss a few days of each ramadan i try my best to make up for the missing days but not always being successful what are my obligations and my options there's a difference of opinions in the different schools of how to deal with this the opinion that we give is that you have to make up your prayer sorry you have to make up your fasting uh sometime even if you don't make up all of the days of ramadan before the next ramadan you just have to tally how many days you have and if you are physically able to fast you need to fast those those days so make a plan for yourself of how to fast the days whether you're fasting mondays and thursdays whether you're fasting a lot in the winter because the days are short like now you know now is a great time to to make up missed fast because the days are short and we have another about month uh a little what is today we have a we have a month and a half about a month and a half until we change the clock uh forward so we you have time you know in the short days so you have to make up the fast inshallah why do men get double while women half when they inherit property from parents so that is that is not entirely true the way that the statement is is phrased there are some circumstances in which men inherit more than women there are circumstances in which men and women inherit the same there are circumstances in which women in her inherit more than men and there are circumstances in which women inherit more than men and if you look at the uh the book that i translated uh responding from the tradition there's a fetwa i believe it's fatwa number nine that i translated that enumerates all of those cases all of those scenarios however in the cases in the instances in which a brother would inherit twice his sister you have to understand that there is a twin to that scenario which is that that sister will always or any woman in in the scheme that we're talking about in the inheritance scheme will always fall under another man's financial obligation if a woman inherits let's let's say i have a sister and i inherit two shares to my sister's one chair either my sister is my financial responsibility because she's single she lost her parents or she's married and she and her husband she falls under his financial responsibility so the share that she takes is 100 hers she has no obligation to use it or to spend it whereas a man has a fight will always have a financial obligation uh whether it be on their spouse or whether it be on their children or whether it be terms or parents etc so people forget that and that's one of the meanings of uh allah says that men have a degree over a woman it's a degree of responsibility one of those responsibilities is financial and that's also spelled out in the court i mean that's a verse so i don't want people to forget that it's not just about why do i inherit half or more or less it's about inheritance is about who's closest to the deceased and keeping in mind financial responsibilities and obligations well i guess this is part of that question if this is islamic law will it apply in the u.s if a person dies without a will well what happens if you die in america without a will which is not recommended at all i do not recommend everyone has to have a will i mean it's not you you really need to make that effort there is a i believe it's a state matter that there is a distribution of wealth according to certain fractions and percent i remember i looked into it once uh that's probably based on you know english common law or something like that uh your your wealth will be distributed that way so it's it's not advisable that that anybody uh you need to take that seriously everyone should have a will and all of that stuff should be spelled out because the state will come in both the state and the federal government and your wealth will be distributed according to those laws whether you like it or not if one's husband does not provide the mahar to the bride from the beginning of the marriage are the nuptials still legitimate i have been married for six years but have not been given any mahara instead have been provided shelter and food so the mahara is not a condition for the marriage contract to be valid so it is an obligation that stems from the marriage contract so yes the marriage is valid of course but the maha is obligatory for the man to pay for the woman in this circumstance she is due what we call the of the of a woman who is similar to her whether her sisters or her friends or people of that social class or whatever you know whatever her cousins uh whatever is appropriate uh whatever is established that somebody like her received he has to to pay so this is something that is an obligation that the man has to pay to the woman even if it's after the marriage contract the shelter in food that's an obligation again like we just said in the previous question you know men have a degree over women i i am obligated to provide food and shelter for my wife this is the mod is something that is beyond that it's like a financial gift to the woman so i can't say oh i provide you food and shelter i don't have to pay the money it doesn't work like that if a man is infertile and his wife is fertile and they cannot have children through fertility services can the wife take a divorce on these grounds as she does not want to be left childless in her marriage sure she has the right to ask for a divorce there's nothing wrong with that in that situation um if he does not provide for the wife due to illness and expects the wife to earn is this considered a form of abuse on her or just circumstances if he steals from his wife what are the avenues for grievances in the u.s so a husband and wife are married something you know the man loses his job or or is sick and can't work there's nothing wrong with the woman stepping in uh to to help th there's nothing wrong with that um so is circumstance you know now the man stealing from the wife that's that's that's another that's another story altogether that's obviously not permissible and if the man is is just like not working because he doesn't want to work and his illness is gone and all of that kind of stuff is taken care of but he's still like not wanting to work you know she can ask for divorce uh that would be grounds for a divorce because he's not living up to his obligations as far as theft depends you know what how the finances are you know because you you say the questioner asked what are the recourses for that in the u.s it depends is this a joint account is it not a joint account all of that stuff would impact how we would deal with that if it's a joint account there's very little you can do i think because that's considered a joint tenants by the entirety type of property in u.s law but if it's your account only and not his account and he steal from it then you know there are probably legal steps that you can take but you would have to consult a lawyer but if that's how you're going to be thinking about things you have to reconsider the marriage you know in its entirety because marriage is not a some people they think marriage is like some kind of like business uh uh you know cooperative business marriage is supposed to be based on love and respect not on not on uh you know not on like a business contract so you know if people are looking at marriage like that you know the marriage is really not going to survive if there are irreconcilable differences between one's in-laws and the does the husband have the right to force his wife to live with the in-laws who are abusing her no he doesn't have the right to your parents are your parents not your spouse's parents as i've said before my wife's parents or her parents are not my parents i don't have i don't have much obligation towards them other you know more than i would have with a regular you know muslim just to be respectful and kind and whatnot often times when in-laws get involved in the marriage marriages you know either severely struggle or the collapse i've seen this time and time and time and time again you know you can't force your spouse you know to love your your parents their their in-laws it's not going to work like that so bring if there's already tension you know bringing your family into the picture uh when there's already that tension you're only asking for a disaster you're only asking for something something bad to happen now maybe there's a circumstance where your in-laws or your parents have to visit or stay with you for a while and things like that in which case you know i think if you establish some sort of parameters or some types of rules um then hopefully you can maintain that type of respect if you bring your parents to your house and there's tensions between your parents and your wife and your parents you know you need to also let your parents know that it's her house right it's your spouse you know you have a house together and maybe you you you maybe you're the owner of of the house but inside the house the woman is the one that's going to be in charge of those of those affairs so you can't overstep that you can't overstep that for your wife it's disrespectful to your wife it's very uncomfortable and you are you're feeding that you're feeding those flames of of tension and we are people that are are meant to stay away from fitna so you have to find ways to uh maintain that type of order and that everyone can respect their relationship but you can't force your spouse you know to fall in love with your parents and you know to treat your parents like their own because they're not they have their own parents that would be that would be abusive does the wife have the right to refuse to work or work from home rather than having it to deal with other co-workers that might put her at risk of zinna of course if you're scared that working or [Music] you know first of all a wife does not a wife has no obligation to work as as we know unless she wants to or unless it's by mutual consent between the husband and the wife but if the work environment is toxic then you have the right to avoid that as the questioner asked what are some duas to strengthen our marriages relationships during the pandemic there is obviously a lot of stress put on families with the lengthening of the situation and even through the coveted vaccine is out a lot of trepidation remains since we cannot gather at the message in large groups as we used to our youth are also suffering since they might not have the normal social development skills if they have to remain at home versus around their peers what can we do to build the bond virtually until we return to our masjid ask we ask allah to to protect us and protect our families and and and to help us uh you know anything that you need to ask ask allah however i do want to mention that i think you have to understand that our children are much more resilient than we think we are much more resilient than we think uh this has been honestly a very minor inconvenience in comparison to the type of challenges that people live with um so while it is has been a very very strange 12 months i admit uh even now looking at pictures you know from last year before march you know january and february or if you watch something on tv like oh my god everyone is so close they're hugging they're shaking hands no one's wearing a mask you know you've become agitated it's been such a very strange year we're going to be okay inshallah everything will be fine we will you know slowly things will roll back and and we'll be able to meet as you know as was mentioned in the question we'll get the message before we know it all of that kind of stuff but the question or the key for us is are we using this time for for healthy activities or not so this is this is a wonderful time uh you know throughout this the covid pandemic and and the various lockdowns and all of that it's a it's a very wonderful time for introspection it's a wonderful time for spending more time with the family it's a wonderful time to you know let's have meals you know many families are now able to have three meals with their all of them as a family together whereas in the past they'd be lucky if they could squeeze out one meal a day as a family so you need to look at those opportunities children they need to feel love they need to feel harmony in the family it's very disruptive for them if they feel any type of tension so it's also the attitude that we bring as adults if we are upbeat if we are happy if we are optimistic then inshaallah that will you know that will influence our children and if we are not if it's the opposite that will also influence our children so inshallah we're more resilient than we think and we're adaptive or an adaptive species allah has created us that way so as we have adapted to this inshaallah we will be fine but we ask just turn to allah subhanahu ta'ala and ask him for his protection and increase i would say to increase our prayers and salutations on the prophet as he is the source of all barakah can we please create avenues such as seekers guidance where male or female scholars can pose questions anonymously and have their fake related issues solved i think the majority of the issues are surrounding muslim marriage rights well that's what this forum is for for us if anybody has any questions that are fifth related you know email the support iccpmd.org email address all of these questions are anonymous um some of these questions are film related that we've answered so my understanding is that this is what this forum forum is if somebody has something else in mind let us know when it comes to witter prayers if one wants to pray three rakats could we do two and one like mahrib yes some say you need to do two finish and then do one more to make it three if so what is this they're just different narrations so you can pray it like or you can pray two and then one uh in the third raka of witter salah is it okay to raise your hands to make dua after you recite yes when you when you make dua in the wizard you're going to make dua like this but you're not going to wipe your your your face you make the art like this and then you just put your hands down allahu akbar and you go to sujud is it permissible to change from singular to plural when reciting in a gathering yeah of course allahu mahadena guide all of us together guide me singular plural is fine there's nothing wrong with that alhamdulillah we donate to the masjid and islamic institutions and charities throughout the year what are the opinions of scholars from the most strict to the most lenient about taking a tax deduction on our taxes to the federal or state level as a result of our donations would it not be considered as a back door way in getting more of that money back into our pockets and would lessen our overall donation so no that's that's the financial and tax system that we have in this country if you donate money to a a charity a 501 c 3 or any other type of charity that has a tax deductible status you are allowed to claim those deductions or that you're allowed to claim those donations up to a certain limit for a tax deduction and as a matter of fact you know america is one of the the most philanthropic countries precisely but this is one of the reasons why because the system encourages you to give money because at the end of the day it's going to help you financially so there's nothing wrong with that it's just a way of encouraging people to to donate there's nothing wrong with with taking that deduction there's no there's no opinion of the shadia on that that's fine it's you have to you know do your best to fill out your taxes as uh accurately as possible obviously we all have that obligation and if you have donated money then that's good for you there's nothing wrong because think about what's going to happen is it's encouraging you to give money to the mosque right many times in mosque fundraisers we don't do this because our fundraiser usually takes place in ramadan but many times when the mosque or any charity in america has an end of the year campaign you know why is there an end of the year campaign because they're encouraging people to give money before the calendar year ends for tax purposes so they're appealing to their self-interest so there's nothing wrong with that inshallah all actions are based on intentions and everyone gets what they intended so you're gonna get what you intended inshallah is it acceptable to ask allah to have patience with you while trying to abandon a sin allah is not a person this this this type of of question this is one of the problems and allah is not your best friend allah is your creator allah is allah nothing is like allah ask for your forgiveness before you even say allah forgive before you even utter those words you will have been forgiven because we need to we need please go back and look at the 19 uh videos in which we explain the 99 names of allah why did why did we go through those names and attributes what was the point of one of the points of those classes is to remind us who allah is um uh when we say leisa kamithi nothing is like allah subhanahu ta'ala we dispel any notion that allah subhanahu ta'ala you know has like feelings the way we have feelings and he's just like a bigger person we're a person but allah is like a mega person no that's that's that's not what we say at all that's haram that's that's disbelief nothing is like allah nothing is near allah but rather we know about allah through his divine attributes the most merciful the most compassionate allah you are forgiving you love to forgive so forgive us that is the prophet sasam taught us in ramadan so don't you you don't have to ask allah for patience you want to ask allah for for forgiveness before you even finish asking allah allah allah for before you even finish it you have been forgiven why because allah subhanahu ta'ala is the one that inspired you who gave you that ability to say that to ask meaning that means he wants to give it to you but but i know i'm going to finish that dua and i'm going to fall into sin again ask allah for again allah the prophet sasam that the angels that record are bad deeds they wait six hours before recording the bad deed so let's say i do something wrong uh the angel that will write the the angel on the on your left that will write down that bad deed in your record will wait for six hours understood that to actually be six and not like a metaphor but to be exactly six human hours so if it was noon and i and i committed a sin i have until 6 pm to do what to make tawba what happens if i make tawba it won't even be written you won't even there will be no record of it there will be no record of it for it to be expunged it will not be written at all isn't allah telling us isn't the prophet sas i'm showing us how merciful and how compassionate and forgiving allah subhanahu ta'ala is so be quick to make tawba don't wait oh allah be patient with me you're like prolonging your you're torturing yourself don't do that make tawba but i'm going to fall into the sin again make tawba again there's nothing that allah can't and will not forgive we ask allah to forgive us all inshallah is there only one correct way to wear the hijab at times i feel like a man a woman's hijab is never considered enough by some people's standards how will i no mine is enough the fact that you even ask this question tells me that what you're doing is enough don't listen to any men who say that your hijab is not sufficient do not ask details about the hijev this is one of the questions that my teachers would refuse to answer and anytime a woman would come and ask they would say you know this is exactly why allah gave us the story of a bakara in surah al-baqarah to remind us that we do not ask questions you know allah commands you to you know sacrifice a cow you know but the people of beni israel they said okay how big is the cow how old is the cow we don't understand how they kept asking these questions because they did not want to commit the act so we are not a people that are are encouraged to continue asking questions detailed questions about an act you know your your your your head uh and uh you know you you're wearing the hijab you're in the hijab you know don't you know don't don't keep uh stressing about that if you have a specific issue you know you can come and you can talk to me privately uh if there's like something else that's like really you know you know uh bothering you but you know when somebody says uh in the mosque oh sister you know don't just don't just ignore those phrases and i know when i grew up i used to i learned to ignore oh brother brother brother i need to point something out to you that for me is like a reaction of like in one ear out the other you know that oh brother brother i have to tell you you you know your prayer and uh you know we're always meeting in this forum so you always you know for the last almost five six years you guys see me in this you know capacity but you know i'm i'm just a normal person just like everyone else so sometimes i'm civilian and i just go to the mosque and i just want to pray and things like that so those those statements uh brother brother i need to point something out to you just sister sister you know your prayer was not valid just okay just say when someone says that good say go talk to tara go talk to the imam and he'll sort it out because it becomes ridiculous it becomes ridiculous and and why are men so obsessed with women's hijab i don't understand i really don't understand i don't understand i mean i'm not obsessed with it but it's something that we learned about because part of islamic law and it's you know something that i have to be able to answer and stuff like that but just like i learned about you know you know sorry to be graphic but i had to learn about a women's monthly cycle and i have to learn about you know childbirth and because these are questions that come up so i have to learn about these things but you know there are some you know it's like some people they they want to make the hijab the be all and end all of all issues um so that's also not normal that's also there's something not there's something weird and not natural about that so you wear the hijab because you know it's an obligation alhamdulillah kudos to you you're my hero it's very hard i totally respect you i'm totally supportive of you and masta tatum allah says you know worship allah comply with allah as much as you can one time say no um he was walking with his companions when he was the khalifa and somebody from a second you know story window or balcony maybe they were cleaning their you know space their living space and they just you know chucked out some water into the street so some of the water came on on them so the man next to satan you know he looked at his clothes and he looked at the and he looked up and he said you know i ask you by allah is this water pure and say to alma he said i ask you by allah subhanallah not to answer this man you know he said that's not how we learn that's the same um is teaching us that's not how we learn from the prophet it's water what's the natural state of water you said it's pure halas why do you have to start thinking that the water is impure now you have to go home and change your clothes and things like that because if that person answered and said oh the water is impure all of them would have had to go home and change but rather we are meant to take things simply you wear the hijab don't worry about it don't keep asking those details just keep going forward inshaallah this is a lesson for all of us inshallah we need to support our women not not not abuse them you know emotionally and all the time where was i okay during salah when we sit and we say allah mubarak muhammad how is barakah to the prophet when he is in his current non-living state compared to the barakah for us living in this world well that's the the error is in the question who said that the prophet sasam is not in his living state allah the prophet saw is we do not say that he is dead uh and death is not the end of life as i always remind you and remind myself that death is moving from one mode of living to another so the there is no non-living state and the dead are dead and no no that's that's not the way of islam at all the the dead hear us they benefit from our dua towards them uh on top of all of that is rasulullah saw him every time you say allah says and you ask allah ta'ala for his prayers and salutations on the prophet the prophet doesn't praise on you imagine that every time you say allah what are some of the ways to help get into the state of joshua and focus during the soda well i just realized now with this question that i forgot to make my video about the prayer so i'll try to get that out before the next uh ask tariq session but the way i told you guys about prayer about making the prayer one long uninterrupted sentence such that there is no moment of silence in the prayer the way that imam al-ghazali described this is the greatest way that i know of to to have hoshua the other thing is uh which requires by the way that you learn some of the a couple of sunnah duas that's also i should mention that that's also important so if you make if you make the effort to learn some of the sunday it's like the dua that you say right when you say allahu akbar before we begin the recitation the dua that you say in between the two sajdahs if you learn those you'll know you will have no silent moment that will help you focus also not making the prayer last too long if you're if you you know if you if you're praying and you know your prayer lasts too long sometimes your mind wanders but only doing what needs to be done in the prayer to give it its full right not to you know to to cruise by it but to give it his full right but no more that's one of the ways so i i remember now and i will make i made a note i will inshallah make that video since we are in lockdown i really enjoy doing a lot of netflash so can you fast on a friday if you have fasted thursday yes there's no prohibition against fasting on a friday an individual day if it's if your intention is that it's a sunnah or a saturday or something that's fine what are some of the resources for dick resources for dicker you can read the book of supplication in imam al-ghazal is you should find it translated i don't know what book number it is but i think it's called the book of supplication or the book of dick read what imam al-ghazali has to say about vikr resources about vikra is going to be discussed in the book in the books of tasawaf so the books of tasawaf are dedicated the science and the discipline of the south is dedicated to explaining what zikr is and how thick it is to be done and also all that kind of stuff so start with imam al-ghazali uh you also have uh imam kosheris which is the you know the the the the the first and the most important book of this discipline what else do we have in english i think there are some of the books who have been translated you know these are the type of authors of the type of books that you should go to to understand how they could has done you know what what's it all about what does it accomplish okay and then the final question well we've gone for quite a long time okay the final question what do the following mean okay a word is is something that you do at the same time every day so i have a weird in my quran i read a page in my quran you know every day after fajr prayer for example you call this a something that a litany something that you do constantly when people say that they have a weird usually what they mean is that they have a allotted or quran recitation that they do every day at a certain amount of time and the word as a form of vik is one of the most important tools uh that we have in our worship in on our path to allah the people that remember allah standing sitting and lying down and contemplate yet they contemplate the heavens and the earth so fik is to his contemplation it's to sit down to think about things to tie things together to take some time just you know sit there and and ponder and ask yourself questions and try to answer them and it's about thinking is recitation so you can read the quran or you can read your wit or you could read a book as reading and tariq means path and in the in the language of islam the word tariqah usually refers to a spiritual path and we liken our journey to allah subhanahu ta'ala as a path so the tariqah is evolves throughout islamic history as an organized way of organizing your spiritual devotion and spiritual practice to arrive at allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and it is you know you have a teacher you have a sheikh that guides you down that path and helps you you know helps you become the best version of yourself so in the in the usage of islam that that's what the word means path but in its usage in islam it refers to the spiritual path allah let me see if anything came in the chat well there are some questions in the chat please make do i for the brother-in-law one of our famous community members sister leena brother atef abdel fattah who passed away in england with covet last week we asked inshallah for shiva for them europe do we have to follow tajweed when reciting the quran as much as we can to to learn the proper the proper way of reading the quran as much as we can we should do that as much as we can please correct me if i'm wrong i heard you saying we could combine the prayers so that we do not miss it can we do this regardless if we are traveling or having any difficulty praying for example if we are at the office could you please clarify i think i'm lost i appreciate your advice yes that's what i said you can combine your prayers even if you're not traveling you can't shorten your prayers shortening your prayers is only a function of travel you can combine your prayers together and make together without traveling so you're at work and you know or you're at school or for no reason the hadith in muslim is narrated by ibn abbas is that the prophet sasam combined his prayers in medina for no reason so the shafi's took from this hadith and they they they use this hadith in their legal structure to say that it is permissible is there a ruling in the shahi school that your wudu is gone if you shake hands or touch an adult person of another gender unless the person is a parent or sibling yes in the shaffy method that is that is the case that if you come into skin contact with somebody who is not your mehram you lose your wudu that is the chef position i know for the hanafi's obligatory in with is it the same in the other methods i heard for the maliki's it's but i would like to confirm it's not obligatory in the other madhhab it's a sunnah in the shaft i meant have to do in with starting from the night of the 15th of ramadan till the end of the month is it haram living with a christian i don't understand the question like as a roommate or something like that there's nothing haram with that i could not fast for the entire month of ramadan due to my pregnancy so i have to make up the entire month even though i feed people who are fasting uh yes because the pregnancy is uh a temporary obviously a temporary situation uh so yeah you're going to have to you'll make up the fast inshallah when you make dua is it okay to do it in english or is it better to do it in arabic where can we learn specific duos in arabic yes of course it's okay to do it in any language allah will understand of course alhamdulillah where can you learn the dua imam in nawai's book the book of remembrance is is one of the greatest books for that and uh it's it's translated into english as the book of remembrance and the reason i like that translation even though i know it's a little expensive that book that particular book is that all of the duas are in arabic transliteration and translation so the book of the kitab atkar is is a book that every muslim household should have it's one of those books that it has for everything you know um if you're sick visiting a sick person you know dog for your children dog for your parents dog for someone who's passed away do i before you eat do i when you wake up when you sleep do i when you put on clothes it doesn't offer everything so that's that's really the greatest resource that you have uh and imam and now we uh you know a lot of mercy and bless him you know infinitely on our behalf for all what he did for this ummah uh he is a scholar of the highest caliber so he you know he also in the book the book is also a book of hadith so the reason scholars are interested in that book is that we we also learn the verification of hadith and how hadith are compiled and and what not so he always uses the reliable hadith to to provide you with the with the dua uh that's the greatest book so if if people want to learn dot you should get that book and you should you know you can look up anything it's like an it's even though it's one book it's like really like an encyclopedia because anytime you have to look up something you have it so that's what i would advise okay i'm assuming there are no more questions um just a couple of uh housekeeping things one is a reminder that for the the q a session that will that takes place the first tuesday of every month you can email the questions to support at iccpmd.org the second thing i want to say is i want to remind everyone that all of these questions are anonymous so i do not know who asked these questions and i just want people to you know sometimes i'm colorful when i read the questions and i just want people to understand that that's just my natural reaction i don't know who's asked these nor do i really want to know who asked them so brother muslim asking me to give you guys the link for the book of remembrance why are all these christian books of remembrance coming up so give me a second here ah here it is send to everybody i hope that worked okay um or where was i oh yeah so the question all of this is anonymous uh if you've asked the question and you know i didn't answer what you wanted or you know you have more questions you know please do follow up either with me directly or you know for the next time insha'allah the point of this is that for me to help as much as possible help you clarify these questions so uh sometimes i answer the questions thinking that i've answered the question or i've you know lived up to the obligation but then you're like no that's not what i meant or i didn't understand which which happens and if that's the case i do apologize but please do follow up uh inshallah you know we're going to do this at least two more times i think before ramadan if i'm not mistaken so we have we have more than ample time insha allah other thing i do want to remind everyone of is uh you know there were a couple of questions about community and you know staying connected and iccp for us is our connection this is our family uh so i do want to remind everyone to to make an effort to support the mosque insha'allah as we get start thinking about ramadan right around the corner just a little over two months uh we will be coming back to the community with you know with our with our ask but you know please do remember the importance of of supporting the message inshallah with that we ask allah subhanahu ta'ala oh wait there's another question can i pray in the car if i'm outside and i'm afraid to miss the time of salah no because if you are physically able to stand uh then you have to stand so you can't you can only pray sitting if you are unable to stand and that's why the solution to this problem is to combine the prayers that's how you get out of that problem so that way you won't have to worry about about praying in the car and on the car and all that kind of stuff so you have to pray standing if you're physically able to if you think that you're going to miss the prayer then you can delay the prayer you know if it's the door you can delay and you can start planning your day around that inshallah so ask allah to bless us all insha allah to protect us to have mercy on our parents to protect and bless our children insha'allah ask allah to give us the light of faith in our hearts insha allah to protect us to make us people of the quran and make us people of the sunnah in sha allah [Music] be you
