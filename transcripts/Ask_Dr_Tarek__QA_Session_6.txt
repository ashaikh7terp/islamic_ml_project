so welcome everyone to this open q a forum i have received your questions i have about 30 i believe give or take so i'm gonna go through the questions that i have first and then we if there's anything that's not clear put it in the chat or we can talk inshaallah we ask allah to make this a fruitful evening and to illuminate us and to shed light upon these questions and these answers insha allah may allah find our evening pleasing to him the first question is and these are no particular order and again these are anonymous i don't know unless somebody asked me directly but these are for the most part anonymous somebody asked a question about how you would pray in space how you would fast as there's no sunrise in sunset uh and how would you conduct worship in general so this is a good question because even something as abstract as that the the prophet sallallahu salallahu actually left us with guidance on so what happens let's state the question in slightly a different way what happens if we can no longer rely on the sun and the moon for our timings in general because that this question can actually happen on earth if you live in certain places where there's no sunrise or no sunset and the prophet saw assalam when he talked about the fitna of the dejan the the antichrist that will come at the end of time and we we spent five or six classes right before the pandemic started last year actually on the signs of the day of judgment and those videos are on our channel we spend some time talking about the dejan and what that means and all of that for people that are interested anyway the prophet saws one of the things that he said is he said when the dejan comes the day and the night and time will become disassociated he said that one day will be like a year one day will be like a month etc so the companions were confused they said well if if there's a day and it ends up becoming like a year does that mean we only pray one once like one day five prayers and then the prophet salallahu he said no you have to calculate for those prayers so that hadith is the hadith which we use to find guidance in these type of situations so to make a long story short the olimet there are different ways of solving this problem but because the question is about space there's really only one answer that works for the space scenario like if we were on a mars or the moon or something like that it which is that we would use the timings in mecca for the prayers and for the fasting we would rely on those number of hours so allah the mother of all cities or all nations so based on those verses and based on the hadith the ulam use mecca standard time as a standard when we can no longer rely on the moon and the sun for timings for prayers and things like that so if we were on you know mars or something like that we would have we would create a calendar of prayer times and fasting times for for at the same time now what is happening in mecca and that's how we saw we would solve the space problem just like we would solve the northern latitude problems places in which you know the fasting hours are too long and what not we've spoken about before so that's a good question well they're all good questions i just i like that question that's what i meant who compiled the 99 as what was the process of how was the order of the names determined why are ya shafi and yakafi not including the 99 names but other names with very similar meanings are repeated more than one for example etc remember when we talked about the 99 names of allah we said that the book that we used more or less to guide us through the discussion was imam al-ghazali's commentary on the 99 names the 99 names that imam al-ghazali used is one narration found in imam tiramiti narrated by radio that allah has 99 names 100-1 whoever memorized them enters paradise and then he went and in the rest of the hadith he narrated the 99 names that was the origin of the or that is the origin of the popular ordering however that same hadith are found in other hadith collections also narrated by abu hurairah but there are slight variations in the names furthermore not all of allah's names are in that hadith because there are other names that allah mentions in the quran in the sunnah literature you know hundreds of others names that are not in the 99 names so that's a common misconception that muslims have that there's only that one text that's where it comes from and that's why there are variations and then that leads to another question which is can we derive names of allah subhanahu ta'ala and the ulama you know talk about this extensively and they give us some guidelines as long as the name that you derive doesn't mean anything negative it doesn't indicate some kind of deficiency to allah it is related to a principle that we already have in the 99 names so on and so forth and that's why many of the men have deduced other names from uh you know from the quran and the hadith literature in reality allah's names and his attributes are infinite because it's allah subhanallah so these are just our way of calling on allah okay can you explain the fick about a man's ear piercing and tattoo is it haram some scholars say that your prayer cannot be accepted if you have two tattoos on your body okay these are two different things altogether with the ear piercing a man having a piercing is not in and of itself haram as long as the piercing does not somehow associate the man with a group that is anti-islamic or a group whose conduct is anti-islamic so i remember when we were growing up and and forgive me if this is i mean this is this dates me but i remember there was a time again a time i don't know this could be very local or there was a time where i remember they would say if a man wore his earring on his i can't even remember if it's left here or his right ear it means that he's you know gay or he's straight i i can't really remember what what the situation was that would be an example of where it would be haram not because of the piercing you have done something to associate yourself with a group whose acts are antithetical to the first principles of islam but if that does not exist and it's simply like a fashion thing then it could be considered permissible uh and and beyond that it's you know personal preference you know it's not my space to say beyond the halal and the haram uh and in the past captains of ships they used to wear piercings because it somehow would it would um i think attract the electricity away from the poles and and all of the gear that they were using on the ship and so there's a history to it and there's a purpose to it and it's not necessarily like i said haram okay tattoos are completely different the traditional tattoo is that blood is in a way taken out of the body mixed with ink and injected back under the dermis of the skin so it's colored so what is under the dermis of the skin is blood and because blood by consensus is considered ritually impure if it is taken outside of the bud the body we are not allowed to on purpose put najesa on our bodies blood or any other type of form and for that reason the tattoo is haram now i know that there are new technologies i don't know what those are somebody's would have to educate me or i need to spend an afternoon looking into them but the traditional tattoo if it's done like that where the blood is taken out of the body and put under the dermis of the skin with ink or without ink whatever that's najesa and therefore that act would be haram now the questioner said what happens if somebody has tattoos you know they did it anyway right they they get a sin you have us you you you commit a sin and you have to make tawbah from that and if you are sincere in your tawba allah will forgive you the sin the sin but then you still have that najesa inshallah allah will forgive that allah forgives things that are ongoing you commit the sin once but the sin is not like every micro second you're not committing a sin it's still a sin it's still haram and your sins any sin against allah is a great thing that we should think twice about okay are there any religious restrictions against women walking alone at night no as long as it's safe so neither women walking at night or traveling or as long as it's safe there's no prohibition are women's financial contributions for the family expenses considered sadaqa if yes what is the source of this ruling in the quran and the hadith yes a woman's financial contribution to her family is considered sadaqa because allah subhanahu wa says that the men are responsible for women that's one verse other verse and men have a degree of responsibility over women so those verses and others and other hadith talk about the financial obligation that the man has towards his family and as we know women have no financial obligation so if a woman spends from her money or her wealth towards her family that is in her not only she's you know doubly rewarded one for helping her family and two that is considered a sadaqa surah verse 51 state something about not taking jews and christians as friends please explain okay so that's a common uh question that people have that's not what the verse says you know the way it's written in english that's not what allah is what allah uses meaning as protectors against the muslim majority or muslim community or muslim body politic so that would be like if we were in a state of war uh between you know i live in country a and we're at war with country b and then i go and i um defect to country b or i sell secrets to country b or i have allegiance to that's what the verse is taught you can't do that you have to be loyal to your homeland you have to be loyal to your people now why is allah in the quran talking about islam and and the yahood and the nasara and referring to him as as religious groups because for the longest time up until you know literally the day before yesterday historically speaking all uh political body politic was was intertwined with religious identity it's only in the last hundred or so years that there is this concept of a completely secular state um that has no ties what so even europe who they you know very foolish but they they they think modern europeans think that they are secular nations they're actually not because those nations many of those nations the irony is many of the european nations that are staunchly atheistic and not church going etc in their constitution and founding documents are states of religion and then there's an official church of the state and then the monarch is the head of the church this that and the other thing those things actually matter the way we look at things so it's really like historically speaking the day before yesterday that nations started becoming non-religious and completely secular in that context therefore the the the address of the verse is not valid you have a jewish neighbor a christian neighbor a buddhist neighbor of course allah says allah does not forbid you from people who are not fighting you not forcing you out of your homes you have to be good to them and kind to them and be equitable because allah loves those who are equitable so there's another verse that in which allah is ordering us to be equitable with our non-muslim surroundings because there's no state of animosity between us so the verse of what is it maida 51 is a verse that has to be read in context okay how can we instill love of salah from a young age so that kids young adults don't pray like it's a burden or just for the parent's sake how do we build on this love so it's not a rushed act especially in ramadan you know these are things that there's you know i can give you an answer the real answer is is that allah guides right we ask for allah's guidance for all of us says prayer is very difficult except for those who have for those who are sincere i think a lot about sincerity has to do with understanding why it is you're doing what you're doing and not getting into the mechanical i'm just doing this because my parents told me to do it so why do we pray why do we have to stop what we're doing and we pray why do we have to stop one month out of 11 and fast and change our cycle and eating and all of that kind of stuff why do we have to wake up early and pray fajr or why do we in the summer have to stay up late and pray etc we need to answer those questions for ourselves and for our children you know because we are created by allah we've been placed on this earth part of our responsibility is to worship the divine it's as simple as that how can i not exalt honor and worship my creator if i understand what that means that allah has given me everything even as i am speaking to you now this ability to speak is being given to me at every micro second from allah how could i not say allah and therefore and to be obedient and to stay away from the haram and to to live within the halal so those meanings need to be instilled from the youngest age and our children need to see that in us they need to see that we're not just muslim when we go to the mosque or we're not just muslim on the day of we're not just muslim on friday but we're muslim all the time and that we stop what we're doing and we pray and we try to pray as a family and and you know the prayer is these are very easy tasks the prayer is not difficult you know we don't have i remember i was in an office in in london uh it was me and and a rabbi and he's an orthodox rabbi actually he's on the board of an organization that i was running and um uh it was time i had to pray i think i had to pray duran asked i was traveling i had to pray lord and asthma because maghrib was coming in or so i i said rabbi i'm sorry i'm just going to go to the other room and i'm going to pray he's like sure yeah okay so i said my prayer and he's like you know you guys pray so much more than us but boy do you guys pray fast uh you know our prayer is very simple it's very straightforward the actual prayer like before we started this recording was it was i mean honestly would it take didn't take longer than three four five minutes at the most and we'll do before that you know maximum one whole minute you know in less than 10 minutes for each prayer in less than 50 minutes throughout the day we are devoting ourselves to worshiping allah subhanahu ta'ala so these are not things that are hugely difficult tasks and that's why allah says it's not difficult if you're sincere if you understand why you're doing it but if you're completely wedded to the dunya and and and all of that and the dunya just is always coming in at you then it will be difficult so we have to instill this in our children inshallah from an early age and we ask allah subhana wa tala to make it easy for us you clarified that during wudu one does not need to remove their socks if one had kept their socks on since the last wudu does the same rule apply to women's head scarf not entirely so you have to wipe part of the hair part of the bed differ is it three hairs as the chef i say is it half the head is it the whole head etc uh so to be on the safe side if you're going to be wiping on your socks especially if your socks are thin and if you're a woman you need to remove the scar or you need to you can lift your scarf but you need to actually run the water through your head okay we usually pray 200 prayers before fajr whoever asked this question please make dua for me and my family when you do that in ramadan after we pray tarawih is it necessary to pray to hajjud prayer again before fajr i heard the hedrew prayer is called ramadan is this the case any night prayer is is called qiyam or tahej any night prayer even the taraweeh is a form of qiyam is a form of tahejut the reason we call taraweeh is one it's a special sunnah prayer that takes place in the evenings of the month of ramadan and the the taraweeh the break is that we break in between the cycles of prayer so every four raka's we we pause a little bit that's the that's the break that we pray for raka's and then we pause in mecca the sahaba they used to pray the four raqqas and then do tawoff seven times pray for raka's do toe off seven times until they completed the twenty and then the the the muslims sorry the the the early generation not necessarily the sahaba and then the muslims of medina they complained to imam malik he's like well look what the muslims in mecca do what are we going to do we don't have any tawof so he said each toward that they make we will pray for extra raka's which is why in some of the narrations of the maliki madhhab as i've mentioned before the taraweeh has 36 raka's so the taraweeh is that the gap in between the prayers in some cultures we sing you know praise on the prophet i saw some salawat in some cultures we will recite like in ichlas you know we'll do something out loud that's that gap um so all of this is sunnah all of this is in the category of the sunnah you don't have to do anything after the tarawih if you don't want to or you can pray more because it's you know the more the better why not but it's not uh it's not mutually exclusive one doesn't cancel the other out okay uh what if at all are individuals with intellectual disabilities example autism down syndrome considered accountable under the sharia do they have any obligations uh of course it's difficult to answer this question in a blanket statement but it could be that people that have these special type of needs or special conditions could be outside of religious obligation moral obligations outside of tech leaf it depends it depends they have to be interviewed and you know there'll be criteria about what they understand what they can perceive what they can't perceive so i'm not going to say an open blanket statement because that's why a lot of these mental uh issues we call spectrum because you you a child or a person will fall somewhere on that spectrum so there is a point at the spectrum which the person will no longer be muked for sure without doubt but there is there could be before that which they are so that's something that has to be on a case-by-case basis if they are not there are no obligations we don't have to worry about you know the prayer that they're they are free uh from that obligation incidentally somebody who does not have all of their senses excuse me someone who does not have all of their senses like helen keller is not mukellif in the sharia even though helen keller reached the greatest heights of that she possibly could have and she wrote and she's and delivered lectures and and whatnot and read and wrote but because she could not see and she could not hear and therefore not communicate if all of those are missing there is no taklif because there is a large part of life than the person is missing so therefore allah will not burden that person so the issue of taklife is interesting once you get into it um i think related to this i shouldn't have made it a separate question should zakare be paid on savings in their name first of all zakat is taken from money irregardless of the person is old or the person is young now if there's a fund uh uh like a walk for that child there's no zakah on the alkaf there's no zakat on those type of funds and my understanding is i mean without knowing what any of the details my understanding is that that's what the situation is like you can you ca uh you create some kind of trust uh who who are the people that invented trust we did you know that's the alkaf endowment trust whatever for this child so that they have a way of being supported for their needs there's not going to be any zakat on that because the takes the ownership of the property or the asset or the money from you and it is given to the pro the ownership is to allah that is how the walk is structured in islam and how it's understood in islamic law do women have to wear the hijab around such person persons who are male not if they're if they're not mukallah if they're outside of the the tech leaf they don't have to allow adam okay at what age should neurotypical kids start paying zakay on savings in their name well as i just said a moment ago irregardless of somebody's age if there is money that's like on the table you know like sitting in an account somewhere it is above the nisab amount one year has passed you have complete ownership of that money you're going to pay 2.5 percent of that so if your kids have a lemonade stand and you know they're going gangbusters masha'allah because of kovit and everyone's drop stopping by and you know they've amassed like since last march 10 15 20 000 bucks and they have it like a lot of shoe boxes in the room we'll take 2.5 percent of that and we'll give that to the zakah inshallah based on anecdotal evidence it appears not uncommon amongst muslims and non-muslims to distort distort or misrepresent their eligibility to get early access to covet vaccines some claim that vaccines will be wasted otherwise or everyone else is doing it so we should too what is the sharia perspective on this situation first of all only allah has power and ability so you know you got to get out of this mentality that if you have the vaccine you've become superman and the problem with people acting like this is is is there's an issue of faith that's lacking because i i've seen it people are like it's almost as if like we had like a bad snow storm and halas now alhamdulillah the snow has been removed life is back to normal oh we're vaccinated it doesn't matter that's not how it works um so what would cause you to jump in line to you know from elderly people and and whatnot and and it's it's everybody trying it's selfish right that's what selfishness is is that you no it's okay for me or it's you justify how it's gonna go to waste or you don't know it's gonna go to waste you have no idea what's happening behind the scenes but we do what we do know is that the system is completely not working because it's taken you know much longer than it should have and we don't want to be part of the problem we want to be part of the solutions whoever deceives us is not from amongst us so we don't want to misrepresent lie steal cheat that's not the way of islam if we want allah be to be our assistant to come to our assistance then we have to also live an upright life don't jump in line to get medicine that's that's you know there's no need to do that you're going to be fine inshallah is the era forever will it reside there eternally if so how is this reconciled with allah alone being al-samad the eternal is eternal by allah not on its own but it is forever because allah allows it to be forever so there's a difference when we say allah is a self-sufficient he is in no need of sustenance he is the giver of sustenance so if paradise lasts forever or if this lasts forever it is by allah subhanahu wa some of us are very anxious by nature and easily upset when things don't happen according to our plan or desire especially during the pandemic what advice do you have for us think about less fortunate people this is an american problem because we are so so entitled that everything you know push a button and now with an app or speak to the phone opens with your face and all of these we're so used to this immediacy that we you you become entitled uh and you forget so think about those who are less fortunate those that are going through difficult times people that are warned to imagine what it's like this last year for the rohingya or for the syrians or for the people in arab or for the kashmiris or for the palestinians you know it just compounded an already very difficult almost unlivable situation for these people and we ask allah subhanahu ta'ala to alleviate their their difficulty and their suffering and when you think about that you become more humble and then you you say alhamdulillah that's the idea that's why the prophet saws said whoever is not concerned with the affair of muslims is not for amongst from amongst them so our task is to connect with with all of our brother and sister even if it's us emotionally to think about that and to remember and to be content to practice to be content and to accept what allah has given us should one pays the care of the 401k retirement accounts no and you need to read the short article that i wrote on my website about it's called thoughts on zeke you can go to my website making sense of islam.com under articles it's called thoughts on zakam and this is one of the things that i talk about i talk about specifically of american 401 k plans and i demonstrate why you do not need to pay zakah on it if it's pre-retirement or pre-withdrawal age and then i offer the fixed solution for the post retirement age which i think is 59 and a half right here whatever the age is it's in the article so please it's not that long please look at it and that will answer your question i highly recommend because no one that i know of in english has talked about this i'm not saying it because i did it but i mean i'm glad allah gave me the ability to do it but there are serious misguidance out there on the 401k issues so i i highly recommend people read that when a person can't fast due to some reason can another person whom he will pay observe a fast on his behalf maybe after ramadan no if you can't fast because you're old or sick or whatever you're going to pay the mud you know the the half liter worth of food per day which is like let's say it's like 10 bucks so you can pay 300 bucks every ramadan to feed those that are less fortunate uh because you're still alive so that's that's how the verse is is structured we can't pass that on to somebody else to do for us um oh related to that what is the compensation amount let's go with like ten dollars a day i think we in the mosque maybe we say even twelve ten to twelve dollars per day it's half a liter of the staple food the staple food there can be different staple foods which is why there's a range but i know you guys are all generous and you can handle it if we don't find a poor to feed and want to pay to the mosque in which fund the amount will go uh i mean i guess we make a memo uh fitra or food or or something put it in the memo and inshallah we'll take care of it are we allowed to fast and donate blood i donate blood to the red cross and have a donation scheduled during ramadan no that will invalidate your fast because intravenous needles break the fast not intramuscular so blood the the the needle is going into the vein and withdrawing the blood that's the body cavity that will invalidate your fast so you need to unless this is like an emergency or something you need to reschedule that i'm in a dilemma i provide hiv primary care and also hiv prevention 99 of the patients that i provide pre-exposure prophylaxis prep for our men who have sex with other men and bisexual men i am really bothered by this aspect of my profession knowing that the practice of homosexuality is haram in islam by me providing prep to this population i feel that i am part of promoting these deviant sexual practices please help me make an informed islamic decision about my job so the thing with medical care is that the oath that you take you know the hippocratic oath that physicians take is to do no harm and this is a this is an oath that predates islam hippocrates is a met a physician that predates islam by by centuries and the whole idea of health care is to help those regardless of who they are even in the sharia when it comes to uh the discussion for example of prisoners of war in the case in which there's a legitimate armed conflict and there are you know prisoners of war have rights the sharia talks about those rights before we even knew what geneva was or where geneva is before probably even geneva existed rasulullah was talking about the rights of the prisoners to feed them to clothe them and these are enemy combatants that you are you know giving medical aid to and food to and resources from the muslims from the the muslim government to these enemy combatants because they're human beings so medicine is one of these forms of services where you have to provide a service to whoever comes you are not responsible for that person's actions so from the sharia point of view there's nothing wrong with what you're doing now if you don't like what you're doing or you feel for obvious reasons you don't feel comfortable by all means work quietly to find another job or another position there's nothing wrong with that but don't leave your job over it don't allah has given you a job inshaallah the income is halal this doesn't mean that what these people are doing is halal please understand that's not what i'm saying but that's not how our fic works you're not you can't no soul bears the burden of another so somebody comes to you that needs medical attention whatever the case may be you have to give it to them just like if somebody came who was a drug addict and they needed medical attention you would give them that that medical attention or if somebody was an alcoholic and they came and they needed attention you'd give them medical medical attention i gave those examples because those are ethical dilemmas that physicians face all the time the physician knows in their bones because they do this all the time that this patient is going to go back out and do the same thing over but i still have a moral obligation forget the law and insurance and all that nonsense i have a moral obligation in front of allah to do no harm to help the person that's in front of me so that's an oath that we take seriously in islam i'm working at a restaurant kitchen which serves pork i got this job with great difficulty what is my situation in relation to my religion similar to the one before or not similar to different circumstances but you are living in a non-muslim land and dealing with a product that is not haram uh sorry dealing with a product that is not illegal in the it's haram for us to consume but it's not illegal so that's what i meant for the general population just like if there was alcohol at the restaurant uh so you as a muslim i don't want to touch that i no one who wants to deal with that but i got this job with great difficulty that's the key of the questioner so no don't don't leave your job over that inshallah your job is halal your income is halal and then pray that allah puts you in a better situation sooner rather than later inshallah can i pray taraweeh following the zoom stream can i pray taraweeh following meaning after the zoom stuff that me and and uh imam rafael are gonna do yeah that's fine turn off the zoom and pray or do you mean can i pray following imam on zoom we talked about that last ramadan and we said that's not permissible so again i guess it depends how where the if there's a comma or not can you uh the way we are structuring the taraweeh the ramadan program is that we will do the online per streaming portion first and then we will inshaallah stick to our a lot of time so that afterwards whether you are in the mosque you will be able to say um you know on your own or in you know behind anise at the mosque so it's a bi it's a it's a hybrid situation this year is it okay to delay aisha prayer till after i listen to the icc yes for what it's worth that's what i do i don't pray aisha until after i finish that that anyway but i feel it might even be before aisha prayer slightly but anyway yeah that's fine you can delay it of course there's nothing wrong with that you have up until right before fajr to pray until when can i eat and drink water in sahur is it okay to do just as the then for fajr is heard you want to stop before the fajr time comes in let's just say for the sake of argument that fajr is at 5 a.m so at 4 59 a.m and 30 seconds i would stop just give yourself a little bit of breathing room to demarcate from when it's not fasting time to when it's fasting time the minute you hear that then and fajr has come in the fast has begun okay there are a couple of questions that came in that i wrote by hand so i hope i can read my own handwriting because i before we got on so we're almost towards the end somebody asked about the verse of the biha because they have a child who's asking about the bihar that's surat al-anayam verse 121 the verse about not eating that which has not been slaughtered with allah's name uh you know that's as clear as the light of day uh are the be have the proof of the the importance of having the et cetera there's a difference of opinion between the fukaha of whether the tasmiyah allahu akbar uh has to be named or not but that's a minor a minor point but the the verse of the de biha is 121. the same questioner is saying that their daughter has celiac disease travels with her school for sporting and other events and has difficulty sometimes finding the biha food and therefore stuck sometimes just having like a milkshake for dinner and things like that i don't know much about celiac disease but also let me inform you that there are other options not black and white because almost anywhere in america that you go there's going to be a fish or vegetarian option and in many places that you go particularly in the northeast or wherever in our area even there's kosher options so kosher is also permissible for us to eat um so don't set the situation up that it's black black and white there are always other options inshallah okay somebody asked about atecaf at home for women so after kef for women can be done at home of course the process of attack f as it is addressed in the primary sources is for men going to the mosque and you know blocking out a set set amount of time in the masjid during ramadan um etc but for women it can be done at home and all you need to do is be like okay you know from like 10 tonight 10 at night to like two in the morning i'm gonna be in my room praying and reading quran that's it just stick to your room during those hours and and don't go out of your room to do you know watch tv or something like that but dedicate those hours to worshiping allah and you will be rewarded uh greatly for that in sha allah somebody asked can you combine your prayers all the time to make life easy like combining us in either time yes for muslims like us that are a minority but not for muslims that live in the muslim majority world they can do that sometimes not all the time but for us because of the great distances and the difficulties and the fact that we don't have ready access to masalas and things like that yes we can do that and inshaallah that will make things easy for you okay the last question i have i hope this is the last one i hope i didn't forget anyone what is the difference between sadaqah and zakar how much of the savings should we pay for zakare and how often sadaqah and zakir anytime you give something that's sadaqa can be in the form of money it can be in the form of assistance it can be in the form of i have supplies that i'm going to give to the mosque that's a sadaqah it's a donation a charitable donation is an act of worship that has very specific conditions that you have complete ownership of your wealth that your wealth is above the nisab above the zakatible amount is has one whole year has passed and the money has stayed above that level then you pay two point five percent on that to the categories that are mentioned in the verse in surah title so something that is very specific and has specific criteria so what is the difference the difference is you do it any time any amount all the time etc blindly to anything to anyone is very specific or has specific conditions again for the person to ask this question and anyone that's interested i urge you to read my article thoughts on zakah because in the beginning of the article i talk about what the conditions are of zakah arts very few and i hope inshallah did a good job in making the zakah issue palpatable for people that read english so again please read that article and hopefully that will alleviate some concerns that people have those are the questions that i have written i know of course the first thing people are going to say is where is the article so let me just do that really quickly if you just bear with me one moment um okay thoughts on is okay we now let me go back to the top is there a difference between zakat and sadhaka i got that question um can you do sadaqa acts for a non-relative who is deceased of course can you combine niyat for salah please share the link for your article okay i just did what about muslim doctors who perform abortions is it allowed uh abortions are allowed in the sharia with certain conditions um and i think the conditions are in junction with the with state laws so i'm going to say yes inshallah um and of course it's different between voluntary sorry there's a difference between the medical crisis and you as the doctor saying if you don't do this you know something bad is going to happen that's in that case yeah there's nothing wrong with that the challenge is going to be if the woman just wants to get rid of the baby because doesn't want the baby and we've passed the 120 days but i think that our sharia is actually more liberal on that than the current state laws i'd have to double check can you pay zakat throughout the year and assassin ramadan to ensure you paid enough yes you can pay zakah in advance for two years uh and if you have like fixed things that you know i mean it is what it is like i have a drawer of gold coins or something like that which i actually do because when my kids were born i got all these coins from relatives so i know that you know they're not going to multiply they're in the drawer you can do that that's fine and you can give an advance and that's actually you know you know better why not if you can help people sooner or why not is the tax can be considered as okay no nice try though but no that's not going to work when combining salah can i do it in between the salads no combine the prayer do not leave a gap in the time or else you will have voided the opportunity to combine so do you know you saddam salaam don't do and you know don't answer your phone or you know think about the heavens and the earth no get up and pray the next prayer um will you expand on how the sharia is more liberal on abortion at a later lecture only if i figure out what the state laws are in our state and neighboring states i actually don't know what they are but um sure maybe the next time we do this i'll just make a little note about that i i'm not skirting i just don't know the the laws but my experience having studied the sharia for so long is i mean maybe people won't even believe when i say this but western law particularly american law or you know continental law is actually actually american law more is very very rigid and strict and has almost has very little depth in the imaginative uh conceptualizing of legal scenarios i'm not saying it doesn't have it but it's not like the sharia oh my god the sharia is wacky with with with the creative and that was one of the because i did not go to law school here so i had to learn american law or or you know for my lawyer friends and from interacting with lawyers and from reading and and observing reading some of the supreme court uh opinions just on you know various things just to understand how it works it's it's very uh two-dimensional uh and and um i i find almost all the time the shadia to be much more flexible and much more obviously compassionate uh but much more creative which is why it's so funny for me when people say oh the sharia law and they're gonna cut our hands off i mean such a such a nonsense statement because nothing could be further from the truth it's the laws here that that are can be very dangerous and you have to be very careful but we'll look into it let me look into it i remember you asked answering a question regarding an unmarried unmarried muslim woman traveling alone please kindly share the hadith you mentioned my niece also emailed you regarding this thank you again okay i don't i i didn't receive an email recently about this so i apologize but uh a non what is it an unmarried muslim woman traveling the prophet saws he said that a day will come in which a woman will travel from here from medina to sanaa to yemen and not have anything to fear that hadith the fukuha understood as a a bushra that a glad tiding that a day will come when which travel will be safe and therefore he even said sallallahu tell him that a woman will be able to travel so the issue of a woman traveling with a maharam is contingent on the issue of safety not the issue of a woman can't travel alone i'd have to look up where the hadith is it's a pretty sound hadith i lost my place online okay do i need to pay the account home equity you know you pay uh don't need to pay zakay zaka is on money not property so if your house goes up in value good good great but when you sell it let's say you sell your house for five hundred thousand dollars and you actually take that five hundred thousand dollars and you put it in the bank account for an entire year and you don't touch it after that year you would pay two point five percent on that but not before how could one pays a can advance on gold coins when price fluctuates and you you you you uh you estimate i mean it's not gonna fluctuate so much you you estimate and be generous if you're gonna pay the care ahead of time that means that you you know err on the side of generosity because you're helping you know people that really need it one of the sisters has an appointment with a gynecologist during ramadan is it permissible to go for a pap test will that that will break your fast because that the the pap the pap test is entering into the body cavity that would break your fast so unless it's urgent or or necessary i would wait until after ramadan um somebody sent me their email i gotta write that down i also want to lose it federal law on abortion roe versus wade allows abortion for the first two trimesters without excessive government restrictions in maryland a parent of a minor must be notified if abortion is provided and abortion after viability can be performed if life is in danger etc okay well i still need to look it up myself uh is it permissible to talk to a potential suitor during ramadan if the intentions are marriage yeah as long as you can control yourself um by the way there's a lot of zakat questions and money related questions so if people are have so much excess money and you're looking for a place to park the money please you can always donate to iccp we will take care of your money and allah will reward you but all seriousness if as we are getting towards ramadan please do remember the mosque in your financial contributions does a nasal spray break your fast yes my husband is diabetic i understand we need to pay 300 to feed someone in need how best to do this thanks so much you can just give the money to the mosque with the note in the memo that this is for iftar and we will make sure that money goes to that is providing hormone therapy for transgender male who want to develop breasts haram i need to know more i don't know enough about about that uh like what is that is that like medical or is that elective or i have to come back to that i'm just going to write it down that's a little iffy because that's not obviously in our understanding of necessity uh and it's not medicine as it is for you know the hiv person or you know medicine so i need to talk to some doctors and understand what's happening um where am i so fast breaks if anything enters the body cavity it doesn't have to be food correct this is about fasting i think somebody maybe i don't know if that's about i don't think you sent the link to everyone oh sorry the email is regarding the muslim traveling alone ah that's a follow-up okay i wrote down that email address and i'll try alone that's elective because they want to look like a woman yeah i know i know i i know it's it's elective but my my thing is do you like go to a doctor to do that or do you go to somebody else is it a doctor and then if you're a doctor then maybe you don't have to like do not can you just like not carry those hormones i don't provide that service because it's not essential it's not it's not like you know you know you broke your foot and you go to the doctor the doctor's got to put a cast on i mean there's no question about that that you know your doctor's going to either do that or refer you so i want to understand what the the laws are and the ins and outs to provide to provide guidance i i need some time on that i understand it's elective i mean we haven't gotten to the point where it's considered you know necessary but but that's something that i would want to find a way to get out of that because that's something that's not necessary and has severe consequences you know for for broader society and things like that but if it's if it's a position where let's say i find out that like you have to do it as a doctor or else you're going to go to jail then i've got to rethink that whole thing because i got to understand which i don't think that's the case but there must be a way that we can differentiate between that and you know like like i broke my wrist or something like that should we not accept awards if we do volunteer work visa bill no why not there's nothing wrong with that we'll encourage you and encourage people around you can a health saving account funds be counted for zakae read my article because the issue with these funds is you have to ask yourself i don't know a lot about about those but my hunch is that once you put money into those accounts it once you put money into that account it's not yours anymore by the definition of the sharia you don't have complete ownership and milkutem is the key condition criteria for the article about not ping's account the 401k because you no longer have that which is a sharia criteria so i need to i would need to investigate that specifically but my hunch is that it would be the same type of setup but if you took that money out i need to look into that but i don't think you i think it would be the same thing hsa account okay anybody else have anything they need to ask or anything not clear oh where's the chat box i lost it okay so i sent the article okay i think we're good so yes where can i get the access to this uh article you mentioned about the uh zakat i i just shared it with everyone i'll share it again it's in the chat box some people are born with both male and female characteristics and parents often choose one for their child when they are infants some children grow up and discover they identify as the gender that wasn't selected and want to undergo the process to change not an expert at all but do i feel sympathy for these people well this is in the sharia called so people that are born with that i guess would be some sort of hermaphrodite uh the shidiya acknowledges that and there are many hadith that speak about that and actually the sharia has a very interesting and sophisticated way of dealing with that but dealing with it as early as possible at birth of course part of our belief is that gender is linked to the biology so whatever organ is more dominant whatever organ is working however the child i mean there's a whole list of like about half about maybe a dozen or so criteria actually not too long ago me and my students were looking at that chapter uh it's very interesting of how you you quote unquote correct that and guide the child towards the predominant gender uh from from birth and that's the key the key is the way we would understand or the way we would approach it is to deal with that as early as possible with how the majority of that child is presenting and then that is supposed to be reinforced by our community and our societies of course we have sympathies allah's creation and allah's you know the mark of the divine and the love of the divine on every creation so this is completely different than the kind of stuff that's gender fluidity and and transgender and the type the type of things that people are talking about now the the thing that's at birth that the shitty acknowledges and deals with is completely different than i just wake up one day and i'm a woman in a male's body and i want to change and that's something completely different but should we have sympathy of course not only should we have sympathy but we have an obligation as a community to deal with this problem as early as possible to help this child grow so everyone remember that uh ramadan is next week of course we're going to talk a lot about that on friday we still have class on friday friday will be our last class before ramadan and then starting monday night inshallah next monday night we'll we'll begin our evening program and our journey into the quran with ramadan always comes the reminder of the obligation that we all have towards the mosque and iccp and helping keeping the mosque afloat so it has been a very peculiar year but insha'allah hopefully we'll be back to the mosque soon so please remember the mosque remember our community so we want we pray that inshallah allah blesses us in these final days of sha'ben help us arrive safely at ramadan we ask allah to accept our fast to help our mosque to grow to keep us safe to keep our children safe we ask allah subhanahu ta'ala to enlighten our hearts with the light of the quran and the light of the sunnah of the prophet sallallahu alaihi s
