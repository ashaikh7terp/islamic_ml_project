so welcome everyone to this open q a forum uh just a reminder if everyone can have their microphones on mute and i'm just going to jump right in because we have about i have about 30 uh questions that i received so i want to just jump right in inshaallah actually the first question which just came in this text message let me read that before i forget so the question is uh that and by the way all of these questions are anonymous okay i don't i don't know who these who the who the questioner is so no one should feel any uh embarrassment you know this is a gathering of of knowledge uh and uh the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he said that the gatherings are secure and that's one of the features of our ummah that when we get together you know people should feel safe these are you know safe spaces so i don't know the questioner is so no one should feel anything so the questioner uh the quit this question is i pass gas very often when i pray and at my age i am old i find it difficult to make will do every time your advice so this is actually a condition that the sharia speaks about frequently uh what happens when somebody has incontinence or somebody like the question or passes gas frequently so what we do in this case is we make wudu for every part of the prayer and we make the wadu and we quickly go to the father prayer we do not pray the sunnah prayers before the father prayer and any type of passing gas or or urine or anything that comes out for that person does not break the wudu so like let's say according to the questioner the problem is is passing gas so while they are making wadu let's say you know they're like lifting their foot to wash their foot or you know the middle of making they pass gas they ignore that they continue the wudu and then they go uh to pray their father the prayer so though her time has come in for example i'm going to make my wudu and immediately go pray the whole prayer don't pray the sunnahs before you pray the father prayer and then after the father prayer you can pray the sunnis and you pay no attention to the passing of the gas or somebody's housing incontinence or urine or whatever the case may be they ignore that completely okay so that's that's how we deal with that scenario okay next question there's a significant number of young educated professional american muslim women who are having difficulty finding muslim spouses some marry outside the faith are well into their 30s with no prospects they face unlimited spouses are there any practical initiatives flexibility interpretation etc that are being taken to help these young women so first uh before i answer the question from the sharia point of view we do have a a matchmaking uh marital services program at the mesjid sister city is in charge of that again it's done with with complete uh it's confidential so people should feel free to reach out and we are doing our best as a community to provide these type of services to the community so if you if you whether you're male or female if you need assistance in that department please do do reach out and i think we have mentioned this before i want to say maybe a couple of months ago we even mentioned it might have been before the winter holiday so this is something that we're doing uh and it's it's starting so you know take some time for it to pick up speed but by all means please reach out the sharia you have to understand that marriage for us and for all faith traditions is something that is divinely legislated so this comes from allah directly allah lays down for us in our scripture and the prophet saw them through the hadith literature lays out for us the rules of marriage the conditions for marriage etc it's not something it's not about can we have a more liberal interpret it doesn't work like that one of the conditions for the marriage is that there is a compatibility uh or there be an agreement of faith and as a matter of fact most uh pre-islamic faith traditions in their orthodox expressions have the same rules you know jews would say that only a union of of a jewish man and a jewish woman is recognized uh at some point the catholic church book about church would have said the same thing and other faiths so we're no different than that uh and the again it's because of for divine you know purposes in other words it's it's something that allah says this is the way it is and then we say samana we say we hear and we obey to the best of our ability that being said you know the questioner brings up a problem right this is definitely a problem and i've noticed this as well that guys are are are not uh you know they're not they're not they're not acting the way that they're supposed to act and the pool is is uh of candidates sometimes it seems that it's thin and i think that's why when we have a service in the community the way that we are trying to do i think that this will help inshallah so i think the solution is that people like us that are in charge of the community and have different roles and capacities we have to make the effort to provide you know these opportunities for people young people or older people to meet uh inshallah we ask allah subhanahu ta'ala is seeking a companionship to find inshallah okay the second batch of questions is it compulsory to shave the head of the newborn girl and what is the age limit no it's not compulsorily compulsory this is simply a sunnah it is supposed to be done at day seven until the end of the postnatal bleeding period of the woman which is called anifes which is about the sharia says average you know between 40 and 60 days so if we go to the outer limit it's 60 days so from day 7 to day 60 that's the sunnah time for shaving of the head weighing the hair donating its amount in silver slaughtering the animal etc it's in that time period and all of that is a sunnah it's not a photo the same question or asks piercing of ears and nose as common in women is piercing of ears and men haram piercing for men is not haram as long as it is not associated with a certain type of sub group and then that subgroup stands for something that's against islam so other than that it would on its on its face it's not necessarily haram even though it might be considered uh for some cultures weird or not appropriate or not manly or whatever the case maybe from the sharia point of view it's not necessarily haram again as i said if there is no association with some kind of group yeah and that group is overtly you know using things that are just sort of not compatible thank you next question do we have to make fresh wudu for each salah and we do allowed on hair with chemical dye not no you do not have to make wudu for each prayer uh if you have we do from prayer to prayer that's fine it's not compulsory if you make a an additional wudu it's just an extra devotional act as for if your hair is dyed you know the hair has taken in that dye and has absorbed that color the dye does not prevent the the water from touching the hair it's not a hat it's not a barrier so therefore that would be fine you just you know wipe over your hair whether it's or hustle or taking a bath and you'll be fine uh next question when we pray salat for rakats one is it okay to recite two-thirds small surahs after the fatah in the first and second raqqa i assume that that means is it okay that you recite part of a small surah when you pray the obligatory part of the prayer is that you recite the fatiha any other recitation of the quran is a sunnah so whether you recite one verse you say that's it or you recite no verses or you recite all of surat and all of that's fine in the third and fourth raka's is it okay if you recite a surah after the fattah by accident yes it's fine if you recite in duhranas three and four if you recite a surah after the fatah is it is your is your prayer still valid absolutely it's still valid there's nothing wrong with that music okay next question um when we travel you stated last week that we can pray pus for three days excluding the day of travel and day of return but i recall you saying that if the intention is for me to stay more than 30 okay so let's go over the travel thing again somebody's there are many microphones on actually and um i'm like yelling and i'll strain my voice so if you could just keep the microphones off and if anyone wants to say something to me they can i i'm looking the chats open for me we're in washington dc we're going to go to new york today is tuesday so we're going to go to new york now and we are going to stay in new york wednesday thursday friday and we're going to return saturday so today is the day of travel to new york that day doesn't count how how many days are we staying in new york wednesday thursday friday and then we return on saturday so that day doesn't count so those three days plus today the day that i'm traveling to and saturday the day that i'm coming back those days you can do gemma and kasir you can combine and shorten the prayers let's say i leave tonight for new york same scenario and then friday morning there's this massive snowstorm and you know the buses the planes the trains the highway everything is grounded i know that i can't leave new york until monday at the earliest at that moment that i realized that i will stay longer than my intended time so my stay will be longer than those three days at that instant that i i'm watching the news or i'm looking at my phone that instant that i find out i automatically become a resident not a traveler so let us say uh what did i say friday so friday you're in new york and though her time comes in you know because of covid we don't go to the mosque so though her time comes in so i pray two and two i prayed to her and to assa and then a couple hours later i find out this news there's a big snowstorm you know of course i'm just making it up i mean just to approximate the idea so when i come to pray maghrib that night i have to pray margaret three raka's and then when i pray ash of course there's no question and then when i pray i pray two raka's ah sorry i pray i shall four raka's because i have become a resident okay so that's what i mean by if you find out or if your intention changes which is fine there's nothing haram with that it happens all the time sometimes people miss a flight or you know things have like that happen okay next question what is the difference between morataba and taqwa murakaba is to observe and be vigilant over your own actions to follow and be conscious and aware of what you're thinking and what you're doing and to make sure that you're doing the halal and to stay away from the haram and if you fall in the haram then you make is like recording you know some people will actually take a piece of paper or notebook or their phone and they'll write you know today i did this today i did this or at night before they sleep they'll think about you know the review their day what did i do today oh i did this alhamdulillah i did this oh i did this i did this that's that's murakama to go over your day why do you do that because you're aware you know that allah is watching you want to be a better person you want to be more uh upright you want to be you live your life more according to the sunnah of the prophet sallallahu alaihi to be aware of that that's the result of murakal so you can think of that murakaba in sha allah leads to taqwa is also if we want to extrapolate a little bit about this topic is also one of the approaches one of the sufi approaches to our spiritual life which is to vary methodologically we are doing the and make sure that we are staying away from the haram what the what the sufis call uh is to take away and remove negative traits and is to substitute them with positive traits to do that slowly one one item at a time make sure that i'm not lying make sure that i'm not backbiting make sure that i'm not gossiping make sure that i'm not looking at the haram make sure that i'm not speaking about the haram make sure that my all of my limbs are not engaged in the haram but going like down a checklist of one by one by one by one that's one of the the meta approaches so some some tariq has some approaches to to solve two x and that's the that's the path that they take and then the other path is the path of remembrance and is the path of love and is uh it is to put love and remembrance of allah primarily first so that the murakaba takes place whereas the murakaba approach is to have the murakaba first so that you make space for the love and for the dik so both are tools that we need the difference is just in the order is it permissible to bake with vanilla extract given that it contains alcohol no if you know that the substance that you have does not have if the substance that you have has alcohol we are not allowed to cook with it what if you go to a restaurant and then you order something and then later you discover that that food was cooked with alcohol that's permissible because at that moment the alcohol evaporated and is no longer present in the food so why is it haram for me to cook with it because it is haram for us to to buy to use to consume to ask for alcohol because it is haram it is something that is you know by consensus it is haram but if it happens after the fact then that food that i would have consumed there is no trace of the alcohol because it evaporated so it's a different filthy issue but if i'm at home and i know that i have a substance that has alcohol i should do away with it you can find substitutes you can find like the vanilla powder and you know there are other ways around the alcohol issue of the vanilla extract next question why am i always afraid of death not so much myself but my loved ones how can i live in peace and stop thinking about what may or may not happen well i would go as far as to say you shouldn't stop thinking about it because the prophet sallallahu alaihi should mention frequently the destroyer of pleasures meaning death say no um he had a ring that he wore in his hand that he had etched in it kefir death is enough of a reminder or omar and you know he'd have it on his hand and yet he'd always see it every day so the remembrance of death and the contemplation of our own mortality is part of life we know that we will die we know that those around us die and therefore by contemplating for it on our own mortality we are able to give ourselves a renewed appreciation for the moments of life that we have because this moment right now might be the ma last moment we might sleep tonight and not wake up in the morning now some people they'll be terrified by that but this moment we have right now with each other this we own this moment allah has placed us in this moment and if we give this moment all of our attention and all of our focus insha allah this moment could be the cause and shall love our salvation when we used to begin our classes you know not every single class but very often our teachers would remind us he said this these gatherings are gatherings of remembrance our gathering of knowledge allah says as narrated by the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam that he has angels that seek out these gatherings and when these gatherings are found the angels stack one on top of another all the way to the throne of allah and allah's mercy descends on them you know and then and then the ship says that and then we begin reading you know dry islamic law and inheritance from things like that why is the sheikh saying that to remind us that the this is the moment that we have this is an awesome moment it's every moment that you are present is an awesome moment so death and the contemplation of death is not something that is morbid it's the greatest motivation that we have knowing that that time is of the essence that time is short that this is what we got to go all in to give it everything that you have that's awesome and even in the west in the western tradition we have this concept of carpe diem seize the day the the stoic philosophers remind remind us of memento mori remember death and they would edge that on the rings and on their you know posters in their homes and they would write their books like that there's nothing wrong with that it should propel us forward if we are scared of death then that means we are scared of the consequences of death which is of meeting allah subhanahu ta'ala but we know that allah is merciful is compassionate allah generous you know all of the names and attributes that we went uh went over as a community in the last series alhamdulillah therefore there's nothing to be fearful of allah is more more merciful that we can possibly contemplate so insha'allah focusing on death a little bit uh even i would go as far as to say daily even if it's just for a few moments when you rise or before you turn in at night should help remind us of that reality to be prepared of it inshallah so do not be fearful because you are in the hands of the most generous inshallah we ask for allah's mercy inshallah i have been wishing my friends and family happy hait or sometimes jeremiah mubarak but was criticized for such greetings as bidah i was also told that veda is a huge part of islam it should be avoided even though my happy friday greetings have no religious intentions i would like to know if i'm committing a bidder act per se so whoever told you that that is biddah they are bidah and that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard in my entire life not the most ridiculous one of the most ridiculous things that i've heard so no of course saying jumaa mubarak is not bidah it is something that is in the sharia because the prophet sallallahu alaihi told us we have a naid every week and that i eat it's friday and the prophet salallahu said that the the day of friday the eid of friday is greater than the actual eid of ramadan and of the hajj these are you know friday is a is a great day it's a mighty day it's a day of celebration and that's why we we are to wear festive clothes on friday and go to the mall why does allah legislate for us this congregational prayer so we all come together and we all meet and greet it is a mubarak day all of the days are mubarak allah says in the quran remind them of the days of allah subhanahu ta'ala so the person who thinks that saying jeremiah they have a major problem the second thing that's easy the second thing that's more disturbing is when the person the questioner says i was also told that bida is a huge part of islam you know that is also not true because bidad is one of those things that the modern muslims have lost connection to what it means the prophet salallahu sallam he said whoever invents something in this religion of ours that is not of it and that's the key part of the hadith that is not of it it is rebuffed and rejected what is the bid are therefore the beta is when you add something that has no basis but what happens if you revive something or you add something that has a basis then it's not a it's a sunnah it's from the dean so if i said for example i would like every first sunday of the month we fast as a community and break our fast together it's fasting from islam fasting is from islam it's fasting together and and sharing a meal together from the sunnah it's from the summer so therefore that is not a bidder it's a sunnah act someone's going to say oh but it's sunday and we don't fast on sunday who said we don't fast on sunday the prophet saws fasted on mondays and thursdays that does not mean in the same sentence that it is haram to fast on the other days why did i choose sunday because it's a weekend for us in in the west whereas in the other parts of the world it's the beginning of the week for us it's the weekend i'm just making this up right now so we'll fast on a saturday or a sunday together because we know that we can do it as a community whereas maybe midweek might be difficult so that's not a bid that's actually a sunnah so is there innovation allowed in islam of course as long as it's based on the principles of islam so that hadith and that hadith that i narrated for you i believe it's narrated by muslim but it's in the 40 collection of imam and now and the reason why included that hadith is that it's one of the pillar hadith of the religion to understand so people like imam and now we understood that vida is not like this boogie man you know at every corner but rather it's about what the principles of islam are so somebody who doesn't know the principles of islam who didn't study us who didn't study hadith and tafsir and etc all of these things there are the ones that are running around saying all this is bidad just like this question the person that is is bothering the question by saying you can't say juma mubarak not realizing that this actually is in the deen it is a mubarak day every day is mubarak okay next question please kindly go over the sajda so okay are the two sajdas that you make before you say salaam and salaam if you have forgotten a sunna act like the tahite this the first tahite in the second raka of luhr and hashem those four prayers they have a tahit would rather sorry in the second raqqa if you forget that then you have to do the you don't have to but it's a sunnah to do the sahu sujud uh before you do salam however the sajda to sahu itself is a sunnah so let's say you're so out of it that you even forgot to do sajda to sell that's fine your prayer is still valid so if you miss something that is an integral of prayer like i forgot to recite the fatah or i forgot to do rokua you have to go back and do that or if you're too far into the prayer you have to repeat that rakah because that raka was deficient of an interval the says if you forget a sunnah act or if you add something by mistake and it's too uh it's true before the salaam that ends a prayer please kindly expand if there are any rulings on becoming vegetarian vegan out of choice uh no there it it's it's there's nothing wrong with that it's not haram or halal it's you know somebody's it's permissible it's somebody's personal choice uh the issue is if somebody wants to do this for health reasons uh is one thing oftentimes i find people that want to do this for ethical reasons meaning the way that animals are mistreated it's also important for us to remember that we have rules and regulations and ethical rules and regulations of how we are to slaughter and take care of our own animals so what's important is that somebody just becomes well versed with what is islam and what is not islam as for the sahaba and the prophet i saw they didn't eat meat and chicken and the like the way we do they ate it very sparingly so i'm not going to say that vegetarianism or vegan is closer to the sunnah but there are definitely health benefits to it and there are potential harm so one has to be educated in those matters next question when can you refer to a person as an imam and when can you refer to the imam or person as a sheikh so in the classical world the sheikh is you know either referred to as either an older person or a head of a tribe or a learned person the imam classically is like imam shepherd you know imam these are like huge figures so the in the classical period the world the word imam was reserved for these grand figures because they were people that that people follow like there's a you know millions of people follow imam shafi's islamic school of law like me i'm a shepherd many people follow imam abu hassani shantali's school in tesco so the imam is somebody that you follow we also call the person that leads the prayer that imam the prophet sallallahu asallam he said in imam and imam is so that you follow him so the reason the imam of the prayer is the leader of the prayers called an imam is because you follow what that person does so it just depends on you know what what what we're we're using the sheikh is somebody in the context of islam is somebody who is learning somebody who has studied the deen somebody who teaches the dean somebody who we owe respect to for having studied and is teaching somebody who has the right to to teach and the right to speak on matters related to the haram etc can you interrupt the imam when he's giving is it right to challenge an imam after prayers of his some people do this loudly and confrontationally so during the khudba no because the prophet saw he said if you speak during the woman whoever speaks during the jummah they have con committed in the arabic language is is a speech that has no meaning and the prophet saseb said whoever does that then they have no drama meaning that they've lost the reward of juma so i mean inshallah still counts and everything but he's trying to indicate to us allah that's not something that you're supposed to do during the prayer so no when the khatib is speaking it is a monologue not a dialogue after the prayer you are free to speak with the imam all the time now people confront the imam i mean it depends what the imam said unfortunately most people that give the khutbah aren't qualified to give the husband you know sometimes people not more frequently they they imam goes off on this that and the other thing and you know sounds foolish so people get upset you know he shouldn't be speaking uh if he's not qualified so it's sort of a catch-22 type of situation i think that people should feel free in matters of the deen to bring up something to the imam you guys talk to me all the time after i speak uh either messages or or emails or phone calls and you know i make mistakes i'm human i've said things in the past that people are upset how i said it and i i take that stuff seriously because i want to improve uh it's not about my nephew i mean this is a huge you know you have no idea this responsibility of of answering these type of questions you know this is this is going i'm going to allah with this list he's going to ask me about this list and how i answered these questions is a huge amena so i appreciate it when people point out now some people they just like to make a fuss and like to fight you know and i'm always i'm always up for a good fight too so someone wants to fight and wasan but it's not right up you know the mosque is not the place for fighting are nicknames allowed uh of course the prophet saw you know and the sahaba had kunyas and they had nicknamed him was as long as the nickname is not offensive so if somebody is short we wouldn't want to call them shorting uh somebody was overweight you know we wouldn't call them fatty and things those type of things are rude allah do not make fun of a group of people do not call people by names they might be better than you this is from the acts of the wrongdoers so we shouldn't call each other by names that could have potential negative meanings you know i remember when i was in school not a muslim school but my my friends called me nicknames that were harmful i think i was saying this recently to somebody i can't remember so maybe some students and you know you kind of go along with it because you want to fit in but at the end of the day it hurts so just because you think somebody accepts those names out of the adab of the muslim they should not do it but nicknames in general is nothing wrong with that yo allah okay if you are praying in congregation and accidentally pass heir and your wood was invalidated should i continue my prayer and congregation no in that case you should leave the prayer and go make wudu [Music] because at that moment your prayer is not valid do i have to pray again yeah you you'll join the prayer you join back if you can catch it or you pray by yourself afterwards likewise if i'm doing tawaf or sai and my wudu is broken having wudu is a condition in toe off it's not a condition inside so if you're doing tawaf around the kaaba and you lose wu do you have to go make wudu and go back to where you were that same spot and continue if you lose your wudu when you're you're doing sigh you just keep going because it's not a condition having wudu is not a condition for psy and the person says i think about the uh part if so this is a challenge is that we'll have to go against the flow of people moving in a direction uh i mean i don't know how the haram is now with with kovid and all those restrictions um but there's no way around that if you lose your would while you are making tawaf you have to make wudu and come back because having will do is a condition of toef is obtaining disability insurance and then there's another question actually if i recall later about [Applause] life insurance so i'm going to answer both of those together because they are the same so in in we have a principle that says that we do not uh criticize a position in which there is a difference of opinion we only criticize a position if there is consensus meaning if if all muslims of all muslim jurists agree on something and then somebody went against them the person that went against them we can criticize them because they went against consensus but in matters in which there are differences of opinion you can't criticize one for following the position of the other insurance is one of those modern issues that did not exist in this way in this picture in the classical period so it is a it is an issue of ichthy head and the other met today of our generation and the previous generation they debated about it some people said it was some people says it was haram we side with the people that say that it is halal because of their evidence and that's fine but if you don't want to follow that and you want to be more conservative or you want to follow the other position that's fine but you can't criticize somebody who uh who believes that health insurance or life insurance is permissible because at the end of the day is a position in which there's a difference of opinion in our our ummah there is mercy in these differences of opinion can a muslim girl travel alone outside the country for higher studies such as a phd without a mahram is there any saying available on this topic her father only listens to the references of scholars imams and sunnah books etc the prophet salallahu he said that a day will come in which a woman can travel all the way to sana'a to you know the capital of yemen and not have anything to fear the ulam took from this hadith the ruling that as long as the path of travel is safe then it is permissible for a woman to travel without amer and so that's fine so you know like modern travel as long as you know you're not going to like some warm you know i don't know danger zone or something like that it's fine and of course you're going for a purpose as far as the father uh only listens to references of scholars blah blah blah et cetera he can come and talk to me my understanding is that that is my role in this community so if he wants to talk uh shop he can come and talk to me about that what is the hukum of playing musical instrument it is permissible for because we do not opine that music is haram when we talked about music in the past we said that uh in the hadith in which music is referenced as one of the signs of yom kriyama coming near we said that one of the important principles of interpreting those hadith is that when the prophet saws lists things in order not all of those things in order take the same ruling as each other and imam and nawawi and even salah scholars have talked about this as a interpretive tool in the hadith so uh that's one thing the second thing is that not all of the signs of are necessarily bad things but they're simply signs so when the prophet saw says one of the signs of the power draw near is that people will compete in building tall buildings that doesn't mean that building tall buildings is haram it just means when that becomes common that is a sign that the hour is near so the other men that looked at music they looked at music in the same point of view that it's not necessarily haram it's just a sign that it will become prevalent etc in addition to the haditha talk about musical instruments have those musical instruments associated with what we would say in our modern jargon a scene a bad scene the scene is seedy you know people are like clubbing and drinking and things like that that scene is haram but that doesn't mean that individually musical instruments are necessary uh talked about music and you know the music that the sufis listen to the sema and musical instruments etc so we we side with those people but it is not haram so as long as the music you're not playing as haram or anything like that it should be okay okay how to calculate zakat spare cash i spend from you unused gold stock investments 2.5 percent of what is extra at the end of the calendar year uh 19. [Music] is not mentioned in the hadith of the tashahud we say it out of respect and one of the principles of islam is that respect surpasses obedience what does that mean remember when the prophet saw assalam was his scribe so the prophet sallam said you know this is uh bismillah rahim and then the quran he said who's we don't know rahman irr raheem just write bismillah so the prophet saws i'm told imam ali okay you know wipe out bismillah rahim and write bismikallahuma so imam ali did that and then the prophet saws dictating he said you know this is from muhammad rasulullah and he was about to continue and then sohail said wait a second we don't know we don't agree that you are rasulullah just right this is from muhammad ibn abdullah this is from muhammad the son of abdullah so the prophet saws told imam ali erase muhammad rasulullah and write muhammad ibn abdullah and imam ali said i will never erase it so he disobeyed the prophet sasim but out of respect so the prophet sasebo said show me where it's written and the prophet saw them with his blessed finger he you know erased it and then imam ali continued writing in the uh sickness of the the sickness that that claimed the life of the prophet sallallahu salaam in his final days uh the prophet saw asked abu bakr to lead the prayer uh and when the prophet saws had a second wind and he came out to join the prayer the sahaba made a commotion to say abu bakr the prophet saws appeared so satan abu bakr went to go back to allow the prophet saws to lead the prayer but then the prophet saw some motion with his hand that said you know disobeyed the prophet saw allowed the prophet to lead the prayer again out of obedience so obedience surpasses uh sorry respect surpasses obedience so in this case we out of our respect and love for the prophet we say rasulullah in mentioning the prophet's name is something that is permissible in all aspects in whichever the prophet's name is mentioned even in the event so it's permissible to say in the then okay next question i have two girls who are born here and very vocal and opinionated in their own ways once my daughter raised a question asking when you obtain a license one of the questions are would you like to be an organ donor is this permissible in islam intention is purely to save another i struggle to answer this with islamic findings although in my mind i i know we say no the the major bodies of the muslim world allow organ doning organ donation rather uh the more conservative opinion the opinion that i follow is that it is not permissible so if somebody wants to follow that they are again it's an issue in which there is a difference of opinion i am more conservative on that because of the sanctity of human life and because uh technically the sharia definition of death is not the same as the clinical definition of death in all circumstances so it's a you know for technical reasons but there's certainly other halemae that say it's permissible what is the normal procedure for janeza burial in maryland if someone has to face the situation whom should they reach out to and what actions should be taken you should reach out to us iccp we're available 24 7 our funeral services there should be a link on the website and we do the best we can to comply with all state laws of course while also following the quran and sunnah or i should say we follow the quran sunnah first and abide by all the state laws and regulations and um you know alhamdulillah i think we have a fairly good system in the masjid so uh please contact us okay there's a little bit oh i'm actually towards the end okay actually this is the last question i have and i've seen our question on the chat so let me answer this last question first i understand in islam there's a belief that graves shouldn't be marked not even with a gravestone which is why in medina a lot of sahaba are buried together and we don't really know who's in which grave that's the first misconception that is not true in islam that grave shouldn't be marked we'll keep going uh the questioner's father is buried in an unmarked grave at a site which is at full capacity i may be able to have a stone placed where he is but it would be difficult to arrange from the u.s um if at some point in the future another body is buried where he is or was what's the islamic ruling on that uh if that does happen uh would that be counted as a sin for me as i should have marked more made more of an effort to protect his grave i understand people in this country are pretty chill about this uh they don't mind not knowing exactly where their relatives are buried what do you suggest i do so it is not haram to uh it is not haram to uh mark the grave uh if we don't mark the grave we're not going to know who's buried where and it is haram except out of necessity to bury two people in the same grave so in i believe it was in the battle of ahud the two were buried in a grave because of the because the casualties were great and the space was um was was limited but the original default sharia position is that no two people should be buried in a grave except out of necessity so to avoid that and to facilitate families going to visit their loved ones at the graves which is an established sunnah the graves should be marked in other words you should know that somebody's buried here what is permissible is that we build on top of the grave itself not around the grave and not you know not build a structure or a dome or you know so or benches so people can sit and visit and make dua and think all of that's permissible by consensus of the ummah what is haram is that we build something on top of the actual grave itself but if you put you know like a tombstone or what we do is we have these little plaques in our grave site in frederick and all of the grave muslim graveyards in this area in the washington dc area you know i would say 98 of them they just have like a little square plaque that just has the person's name and date so when you go the family can go and visit and as time passes uh no one else will be buried there so that's what i suggest insha allah you have no sin but the questioner who's also a dear friend i suggest that you follow my advice which was my advice the first time we talked about this insha allah to facilitate and i'm sure that you can do it from here allah will make it easy for you donation this is from me to you a reminder that we need to support the masjid so i want everyone to please in the coming today tomorrow and the coming weeks to please make a concerted effort to give insha allah to the mosque uh we're still here we're still kicking in ramadan is right around the corner so it's a good time to exercise the donations okay now i'm going to turn to the chat uh is this being recorded it is being recorded and it will be up on the youtube channel within a day or two uh and i think there's a playlist now called uh ask dr tarek which this will appear and i just realized now that the last one only i recorded and i have to upload for for you guys what is a ruling buying a vehicle or a house which includes interest it is permissible because as long as there is a as long as there's a sub object between you and the loan the finance loan is permissible assalaam i have a few questions for you is it haram to pluck your eyebrows uh not if you're married with with knowledge and permission of your husband but for people that are single it is because of the hadith that's the shafai position what is the view on halal water permeable nail polish if it's if it's water permeable and one time i think maybe a year and a half or two years ago my wife got like several of them and i actually tested them and and the ones that she used i can't remember the brand names they were water permeable and therefore they are halal because if the water will permeate the nail polish and land on the nail then the nail polish is not a hat and it's not a barrier and then therefore the water will reach so it's permissible is it permissible for non-men and women to interact or have friendships beyond business work and school there is no such thing as friendship between men and women we have respectful engagements but anybody who thinks that a man and woman can be friends or just friends doesn't happen so of course you interact uh you know i have many women in in my life that i interact with relatives who or non-relative neighbors etc i mean you interact with all of them you know but we don't we don't go out uh and hang out you know my wife is not present because that's gonna that could lead to to dangerous stuffs and shubha and and i know i know it sounds sometimes archaic but you have to you have to understand that on this matter islam is preventative you know allah is like i want to prevent you guys from from following in to problems and i might i know i don't want to get into you know story names and stuff like that but i do know of you know one story pops up in my life it's not something that happened in this community at all so no one has to to wonder but there was this situation where there was a guy and a girl you know a man and his wife and we were friends with them and you know the man was you know this this you know a personality guy and he's into finance and you know mashallah who's doing really well and he's always busy and closing the deals and this and that you know he's like swiping the world with his sword and he's getting bonus after bonus you know michelle they're doing you know phenomenally well financially but all of that cost that his wife was lonely and then the kids were getting older so the kids were in school so you know there was this guy i mean alhamdulillah nothing haram happened but but it could have happened unless the man the husband you know stepped in and all of that was because she was essentially being neglected and he was working really like super hard you know 20 hour days that kind of situation and you know there was one of his male relatives who's not her mehram they were friends and you know things sort of you know escalated and i remember i had an interaction with that situation and it was a big for me and i think one of the reasons why allah allowed that to happen in my life is that i saw that and that was a big warning for me like don't think that you are special you're not special you're a guy you know she's a girl anything can happen and let's just prevent the whole thing allah says do not even come close or near to zinna meaning all the preamble the pre-steps don't get involved in that you can have relationships you have associates you have colleagues you have neighbors you have relatives that's normal there's nothing haram with that but everything has to be done with decorum but this idea of having friendships beyond business work in school i don't believe is possible and i caution against can you explain about ribba is it okay to take loans if needed is one thing and a loan from the bank is another thing allah says that in the quran is very clearly by consensus of the ummah loan from the bank and bank interest bank interest is not riba is something else taking a loan from the bank as long as it's not a personal loan but if it's a loan to procure an asset then it is permissible inshallah i was wondering if punishments that entail stoning or whipping are still applicable today in our time in society as there is a view that these types of punishments may be seen as extreme additionally where are these laws extracted from so in reverse order they're extracted from the sunnah and the quran you know so uh the stoning and this and that that's that you know you find primary sources all there's nothing hidden in the sharia except that it's backed by quran and sunnah as far as its applicability there's a difference between we have something in the books you know the book says this this is the the punishment for this act there's a difference between that and then applying it because to apply it you have to have these preconditions the preconditions that there are certain amount of weaknesses that the that it it is permissible that the ruler deems it appropriate to enact these punishments but it's also within the ruler's discretion and this is from islamic governance asia it's also from the ruler's discretion to withhold those punishments and to enact another type of punishment so what we want to do is we don't want to fall in one extreme and say oh this is antiquated and this is barbaric and you know islam is is uh has to be modern that's one extreme which we don't want to be and we don't want to be the other extreme we have to bring back the sharia and we have to you know whip and stone and cut digits and things like that that's another extreme where the studio hasn't gone anywhere the sharia is still there but there's a difference between the text understanding the text and applying the text in a country like egypt the hadood punishments were not applied over maybe it's been more than a thousand years that the hadoop punishments haven't been applied not because the other neglected the quran and sunnah but the applicability of it was not appropriate for a whole sort of host of reasons so avoid those extremes and and be in the middle and do say what i'm saying which is yeah those things exist because that's from quran and sunnah i don't deny them but there are conditions for those to be applicable and it is within the purview of the government the hacking the ruler the ruling person power etcetera the government to withhold the hadood punishments why where does that come from because there's a hadith which became a principle of which the prophet saw is reported to have said approach the punishments with doubt meaning if there is any doubt at all you cannot enact the had punishment so the the has understood from that that's almost another way of saying that is you know you really can't apply these punishments because there's always doubt uh and there's always the possibility of doubt so therefore there have been other punishments that have been developed you know incarceration and things like that it's a longer topic but don't deny the quran and sunnah at the same time understand that there's a difference between the quran and sunnah understanding it and applying it if a woman is menstruating is she permitted to enter a mosque and if not if she begins her cycle while she's in the message must she leave it's not permitted for her to enter and to remain in the mosque but if she has to like grab something or if it happens when she's in the mosque or she's passing through that's fine but not to remain in the mosque the mosque here being the place of prayer for those of you that are in our mosque that's why we have the library and the cafe because those would not be considered in the mosque in the mosque means like the the main prayer hall uh the place of prayer and that comes from the hadith as well has nothing to do about women are not clean or you know what some guys think it has nothing to do with that it's just there's a text that says that so uh incidentally nine out of ten of my classes when i was studying took place at either the azhar mosque or we call it a mosque and the sultan hasan mosque which technically according to the shri are not mosques but they're schools and the reason why we had classes there is that precisely for this reason is that the girls could attend all year round all the time because it's not considered a mosque by its walk document what is the email address i should direct my questions to that is a very good question i don't know somebody can help me out is it permissible to bring flowers to the grave it's permissible but there's hadith i think there's a hadith about green some green plants uh i read it earlier when i was looking at the question of the grave um that hadith escapes me but flowers is a western thing we have other green plant-like things i forgot but it's not haram but it's not also what we do culturally it's it's weird how can i get more hoshua in my salah um well there are two suggestions one is not to make the prayer too long because if you're standing there idly you know your brain can wander and even if you're standing there for a second our brain wanders masha'allah but you know the idea is not to do too long and the the second thing which is what i talked about i can't remember if it was last the last time we did this or the time before is that to make all of the words of the prayer not to have a silent moment in the prayer so allah see i there will be no quiet moment your tongue will be like one long sentence between you and allah and i now i remember that i did say i was going to make a video uh and i didn't do it so i i apolo please forgive me and inshallah i'll do my best to make the video for next time uh i i want to demonstrate this for all of you you need to learn a couple of extra dua uh in the prayer but if you learn those which shouldn't take longer than a week or two you'll be able to see how the minute you say allah to the time you finish there will be no quiet moment if you keep doing that each prayer then you have a better chance of focusing and your mind will wander why can't women visit graveyards or is it cultural no there's no prohibition against women visiting the graves that's must be a cultural thing can we wear rings that have the shahada on it sure and it's domino and papa john's pizza haram to eat no as long as it doesn't have pepperoni on okay support iccpmd.org is the email address for questions support at iccpmd.org and they're all confidential so like i said like when i receive the questions i don't know who sent them i just receive a list so this is completely confidential and people should feel comfortable to ask and we take the confidential things seriously i believe the hadith was in sahih muslim and it was putting a green leaf from a date palm tree and putting on the grave to reduce punishment in the grave i believe that is correct do you have any tips on how to have a successful halaqa group make sure the person leading the group is trained you know and how also how to make it more inviting well the problem with this idea of the halacha is that what ends up happening is like it's like the lowest common denominator and it keeps like descending descending descending to descending and then everyone's like you know what i think about this verse that's that's a bad sign the the point of these gatherings of learning is to impart it's got to be a coach there's got to be somebody there that can help guide the group that has to be learned enough to sort of put down you know the parameters and if things go off the rails to help bring things back you know to what is correct so it's very important that there be some level of training and some authorization by a senior teacher for people to to leave the halaqa at one point there was a member of my family who was attending and every time they would come to me you know in last week's halacha we said this and we said that and it was it just kept you know over the years it kept the kept degrading in its quality and it's and it's all because the people weren't uh knowledgeable uh how can you make it more inviting you have to you know be curious there's an art to teaching and presenting the information you have to be more charismatic you have to be open you have to not be controlling you have to let people express themselves people need to feel safe and feel comfortable uh because this is a micro version of how the prophet saw sat with the sahaba would any of us have felt uncomfortable unsafe unhappy in the presence of rasulullah no he would we would you know we would be we'd be so overwhelmed with joy and happiness we we just you know that's why when the sahaba were described in their gatherings of the prophet saws they were described as if there were birds on their heads they were so still and just captivated by his presence sallallahu this is how islam is passed so when you have these gatherings you are passing on the tradition of the prophet sallallahu alaihi so therefore you need to you need to imbibe that sunnah that internal sunnah you have to become that as best as you can and to be able to pass that on uh to the people after you so that's how you make it more active and more engaging etc thank god domino's what is your best advice for a lifelong student of knowledge and how does one remain consistent you need to make rasulallah number one in your heart and in your mind it's not about the books you know there are so many of these crazy self you were heavy people that that you know probably you know read hundreds of books but subhanallah they just have no tawfiq in what they say and they're just lost and they and they cause people to be lost around them exactly like the prophet sallallahu alaihi he said you you diminish your own prayer when you see them pray well and your own compared to those you they pray all the time they fast all the time they read the quran all the time but the prophet saw said that the quran does not go past their throats it does not penetrate their hearts allah says in the quran so studying knowledge it's not about how many books you've read and how many things you've memorized and it's the the the data points the the the knowledge comes the real knowledge comes from tatwa where does that tackle come from it comes from making the prophet sallallahu asallam number one in your heart the prophet is is larger than we can come for he is the essence of islam he is the essence of the created world he the world was created to manifest the beauty of the prophet so therefore when you focus on that as a as a devotional practice when you come to approach the quran and the sunnah you are bringing that you're going to have a new clear lens by which you look at the material that you're studying so that's the first thing i would say the second thing is that you need to get used to these things that you see behind me you got to get used to them you gotta get used to reading and researching and and going back again and forgetting and going back again and many times people ask me questions like oh i gotta look that up i'll look in the book and i'll find an underline my own handwriting in the same answer you know from like five years ago i forgot it so then you remember you go back over research to go over and over again was asked what made you uh your memory is strong and he he said it was just by looking at books so frequently just by opening books and reading and referencing and looking here and looking there over and over and over again so it's something that lasts forever and you have to be committed to that how do you be committed to that ask allah to give you tawfiq because there are many people who start and then they just lose steam my experience is that most people that lose steam some people it's just not for them that's okay but but that's not who i'm talking about but some of the people that lose steam the reason they lose steam is because maybe their intention wasn't 100 correct in the beginning they they saw they were seeking some kind of dunya from it there's no dunya here right this is to pass on allah's deen this is to pass on the sunnah of the prophet sallallahu we seek no dunya from this whatever allah wants to come out of us will come out of us whatever happens to us and the dunya happens we're not seeking to trade with this but rather we are seeking to guide the way that the prophet sallallahu alaihi those those are my my thoughts allah give us to feel inshallah for reasons of quality and accountability in isis the holocaust can be held only with the permission of the management yeah that's another way of saying what i was trying to say so thank you brother molson for writing that sometimes brother martin is my you know like that guy luther uh from well i can't remember the canadian's name he was like he did this sketch where he was obama's uh anger uh translator so so i'm not angry but brother mohsen often times he's my translator he can just say the things that i really want to say but i'm trying to be diplomatic and he just says nope so that's exactly what i was trying to say you know there are alhamdulillah great resources i i mean i'm not saying i'm a great resource i'm saying at iccp we have great resources we have a lot of activities and programs we're trying our best to you know to stay in touch with everyone uh and i think one of the secret uh uh you know components of our of our secret recipe of our recipe is that you know everything is done in an organized way it's not like the wild wild west you know some messages you go to so everyone is doing you know all sorts of different things and alhamdulillah since day one we've really never done that everyone stays in their lane and i think that that's why there's a lot of toffee if people have suggestions of course we have we're open to suggestions but we try to make sure that you know from the religious programming side you know we always try to make sure that myself tariff and ennis you know we're always on the same page and you know the ships are all going in this in the same direction i think that's really really important will we be held accountable for someone else using you as an example for example you don't go out wearing the hijab correctly and that inspired us to do the same like a younger sibling i mean you know yes and no i i mean we influence one another uh so whether we like it or not people are influenced by by us and what we say and what we do um but there are ways that you can preempt that um you know i don't think a woman who's who's struggling with the hijab i've talked about that many times that it's a real struggle that it's serious it's not to be taken lightly and men need to understand that i don't think that she's at the same time saying oh this is okay be like me uh so you know maybe if it's in this case maybe it's your younger sister maybe you need to say that to your younger sister you know it's something that i'm struggling with you know maybe she needs to hear you say those words and then you can preempt that and then she will admire you for struggling she will admire you from be for being brave and being transparent about your you know your humanity and things like that so you know you can do something only bears soul what it can what it can burden will take the sins of another so inshallah you're not going to get any sin like you know you're the cause of like you know somebody going astray but it's important to be cognizant of the impact that your presence uh has on some people and and and to preempt uh what may may happen i think we've reached the end of the list if there's unless there's anything burning i think we can call this a night again i feel when we start you know people start having questions so if you have questions that pop up whatever the question may be you know these are great opportunities for us to learn various aspects of our deen write them down send them to the email we'll compile them and then i get them about a day or two before and then i share them so if you have questions that you want to ask that we're not asking answer today please send them to the email address and inshallah i'll take care of it next month we'll end with our with our salawat inshallah [Music] [Music] foreign you
