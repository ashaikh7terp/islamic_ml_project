foreign how can you tell or identify if someone is in the context of the Holy Quran Hadith in today's world please explain with examples please advise possible solutions to take after identifying in our society as recently I have encountered a person who is a regular mosque goer performed Omega several times but advised me to consume Haram to mitigate my personal problems will this person be labeled if so please advise the possible remedial Solutions needed to correct the person or should I just ignore and go on with my daily business is hypocrisy I've been teaching the last couple days so I think my I'm losing my voice is hypocrisy meaning that people outwardly claim something and inwardly they believe something else so by definition it's impossible to know who's the monetary so we have no uh uh order we have no command we have no incentive to seek out the people that are the people of ordered not to tell anyone else who was the hypocrite and the reason the prophet saws [Music] he's an actor the prophet passed if one of the Moon efforts died and the companion saw that her life didn't go to the mosque to pray the Janessa then they knew that this person was and they just buried them so therefore no we are it's absolutely forbidden that we judge one another or that we sort of have like a list or like a um a score system in which we score who's a Believer or who's a Believer who's a hypocrite this is very dangerous we don't know so we ask God we deal with each other based on face value as for this this person that told you to do something Haram they told you to do something Haram that's wrong don't obey them that's it it's as simple as that just like when yourself coaxes yourself to do something Haram we are meant to to fight that so there's nothing there there's nothing there's nothing to be done other than ask Allah for protection and this is a caution that we are not to judge one another because only Allah knows what's on the inside now of course if there's somebody in the community who's outwardly doing crazy things or wrong things and it's public that's different that we know that what this person is doing is wrong but still we don't say that this person is bad because again what is between the person and Allah only Allah knows so this is an instance in which we would negate the action but we would not negate the person you know hate the the sin not the sinner well that's a Christian phraseology but you kind of understand what I'm saying how do we reconcile completing a Hamra recording especially hugs when the Saudi government is killing yemenis deporting uyghur Muslims back to Chinese concentration camps this question has multiple components the first component is that we cannot judge on the internal dealings of another country unless we know the details of what's Happening this question is the heart of the problem with the Western mentality is that we think that we know everything we call hubris American hubris Muslim Americans we also have Muslim American hubris we think that we know more more than the Muslim World better than the Muslim world so on and so forth one of the one of the things that they train us when we we get trained to give fetwa is you cannot give a fatwa based on another country's judicial system so somebody comes and tells me I had a situation in which a lady came claiming that she got divorced in a Muslim country and uh she wants to remarry I said we have to show me the paperwork of this divorce so after investigating it turned out that she has no proof that she was divorced which means that she's still technically married so you have to be very careful when you judge number two or still on that part of uh us forming opinions of what's happening in the Muslim world is you have to understand that there are factors that are not going to be known to us there are intelligence factors we we lament any loss of life not just Muslim law we lament the loss of Muslim life first and foremost we talk about the refugee crisis the majority of refugees in the world are Muslims we talk about the plight of the uyghurs on the rohingya the people suffering in Syria Yemen this is what I'm saying has nothing to do with that at the same time unfortunately there are political um things in play that have to do with sunnis and shias that have to do with the Iranian regime which I would say has nothing to do with religion has to do with politics and power and and statecraft and there is a hand Iranian political hand intelligence hand through Hezbollah and other Shia groups in the Arabian penises we we know this and we don't even have to be briefed on intelligence briefings to know that this is not justifying the loss of life I'm just saying that this is part of the calculus of the government so for the Saudi government they're looking at it completely there we're looking at it we see it online we see our feed we sell stuff for Allah the algorithm feeds you more stuff for Allah so then you form this opinion that these people are are bad and you forget that this is a duly constituted State the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia now that does that mean that we like everything that this government or that government's doing absolutely not but we pray for the success of all of our governments because they are part of the ummah of Islam so this idea that uh we are the only good Muslims and all of the Muslims in the Muslim majority world are bad and backward this is a very dangerous way of thinking our attitude rather should be to pray for them because the salaf they prayed for those that were in Authority because those that are in Authority are those in Authority that can make life great or Life Health for tens of millions of people number three there is no boycotting the Hajj this is Hajj or amrah visiting the house of Allah just like there's no boycotting going to Jerusalem there has never been a fatal in the history of Islamic law Banning Muslims from traveling to make the Hajj and the Hamra or to visit Jerusalem except in times of plagues in which there was a medical reason why people couldn't go like in the recent pandemic that's happened in the past but when I sat with the Mufti of Jerusalem he he was begging me please tell your community to come and visit us we want people Muslims from around the world to come and visit us this idea that we're not going to go to Jerusalem because Jerusalem's occupied this is the way the echuan think and this this nonsense that they spew out it it leads to a question like this so now people are going to say I'm not going to go to ombra and uh Hajj because the Saudi regime is corrupt this is a false way of thinking a false narrative it's not black or white going to hajjan Ahmed as your religious duty to your religious right uh it happens to be controlled by this government it's an Islamic government when we go there we're respectful we follow the rules and laws we make do I for those that are being oppressed loss of life we go do our business and we come back you want to play the politics game you have to get in politics and learn in some of my work I do work with intelligence groups around the world and I'm telling you when you sit with intelligence people and they open the books you see a whole you see the world in a whole different way there are many many different variables that the average person doesn't have access to this is not to justify the loss of life I'm saying that this type of question it assuming that the Muslim world is backwards and we as Muslims in the west are enlightened this is not this is not the case at all so no there is no boycotting you should go make your Umbra you should go make your Hajj if you're able to go to Jerusalem you should go visit and at the same time with the same breath we mentioned the plight of our brothers and sisters because at the end of the day Muslims are killing Muslims I mean how is this pleasing to Allah it's not it doesn't matter if they're Sunni or Shia or ibadi or doesn't matter we don't persecute people the loss of life is the loss of life it's a it's a invaluable the human life Adam Allah says we have honored the human being so you have to be more sophisticated in your thinking and it's not black and white but most importantly please be careful Before You cast your judgment okay I would like to know whether if both the husband and wife work and the wife saved more than the husband does the wife have to pay the mortgage and all the major expenses of renovating and maintaining the property and if they give divorce can the husband give 50 of the assets please note that the husband didn't want to pay any mortgage and kept totally separate account and didn't want to take any financial responsibility of his wife the wife retired with a low pension but has good savings alhamdulillah but she doesn't know anything about her husband what his husband does with the money can the wife contribute to the finances of the house of course if the wife wants to contribute to the finances of the house if the wife contributes to the payments of the house the upkeep of the house in the Maliki method in the case of divorce or in the case of death the woman can take up to 50 percent so I'm warning all couples that come to me to arbitrate I am very difficult when it comes to divorce and automatically I err on the side of the woman unless I find that the woman is playing around and I try to but I'm telling you up front because this is the kind of nonsense that I see all all the time we know this is not 1555. I mean the husband hides his money in another account doesn't tell his wife like she's a piece of garbage and then she's paying spending the money of the house what is that he says it's not war it's supposed to be marriage what happened to mawada and Rahman love and mercy so yes in the medical method it's called the the Imam of Malik because a lot of the malachies grew up in the desert in North Africa so they see this woman in some Farm village doing everything that the man is doing slaughtering the animals skinning the animals drawing well carrying all of these things he said how can the man die and then she gets nothing that doesn't make sense so in the magic this is a it is permissible for the wife to take up to 50 does the wife have to contribute no she doesn't have to contribute can the why can the husband uh hide his finances it's not a question of right or wrong or Haram and it's a question of you know what is what is your concept of marriage imagine going to business with somebody and from the very beginning you're hiding everything from your partner do you think this business is going to work or that partnership is going to work that's the same thing with marriage so when you start talking about rights and responsibilities and my right you're right from the very beginning it's usually a bad sign that people are entering the marriage with the wrong the wrong idea what financial responsibility does the wife have for her husband according to our religion zero the wife has no financial responsibilities or obligations towards her husband it's the husband who has to support his wife again that's the default ruling in in today's day and age most of us have dual income houses because that's the nature of life which is where that opinion of the American comes from because in those societies the women had to work and contribute to the upkeep of the house the wife has been paying for everything and the husband only pays the utility bills and some other minor expenses buys plants groceries Etc so if the wife is spending from her money this is from her fuddled from her generosity in the marital house and sometimes you know money is up and down sometimes you win sometimes you lose some people lose jobs or they switch jobs I mean you know life is full of of bumps and if the woman uh contributes she is rewarded for that but to ensure that the woman is not uh you know shifted at the end of the path if she if the husband dies and or there's a divorce yes we can make arrangements from the beginning of the marriage contract or from the where the way property is titled like in this country of joints joint tenants by the entirety things like that that can mitigate some of these problems okay I am at the doctor's office and it's time for I have wudu but nothing to cover the head to say my Salah as I felt it was not the right attire for prayer is it correct on my part to forego my prayers as I had no scarf to cover my head thank you so obviously this is a woman uh in this case make the intention to delay praying and combine it with I said don't don't be in a position where I'm just going to miss the prayer don't do that you have an option which you can delay the prayer so you're in the office let's say it's uh 5 30 right it's the end of Oscar and you have a doctor's appointment uh I think medical is like around six six ish and it's getting earlier uh you have wudu but you don't have a hijab to cover your head one of the requirements of prayer is that you have to be able to cover the parts of your body for men and women that have to be covered or you have it but there's no place to pray so rather than figuring all of that out and being worried just say okay I'm going to delay Madrid and I'm going to combine it with ashat when I go home and that way you don't sin you don't lose the prayer and when you go home you can pray in which you are comfortable okay however I would also say that for both men and women irrespective of how we're supposed to dress if a woman doesn't wear the hijab she should be accustomed to caring when she's praying a uh a a hijab with her in her bag just like if there's a guy and it's the summer time and he wears shorts irrespective of whether that's right or not I'm just talking about real brass tacks he should carry with him in his bag or gym bag you know pants or something like that so that when the prayer time comes you can cover yourself and you can pray because you might find yourself in a situation where I haven't prayed I was going to delay with Asar and now is about to come in in that case we have to pray there's no delaying it anymore so in that case you have to pray so we should teach our children that this is like when I was young and we started driving the uncles in the community that's what they advised us you know carry in your car or in your bag you know pants or Lungi a Lungi or something like that in the Arabic they call futa Izar is the first heart word it's the same thing and and that way you're prepared for the prayer are vasectomies okay they have reversal procedures if you want to change your mind later no vasectomies are not okay nor is clipping of the Fallopian tubes for The Woman except if it is a medical procedure that is dictated by The Physician for overall health reasons but from the fact from the point of view of uh I don't want to have kids no the type of contraceptives that are permissible in in the Sharia are temporary contraceptives why because even with temporary contraceptives pregnancy can still happen ing most likely it's not going to happen but it could happen but when you try to make something permanent that Allah has facilitated then this is we enter into the Haram so in this case just a regular guy or a regular woman I don't want to have kids anymore no use uh regular forms of contraceptives and the sahaba practice forms of contraception contraceptive themselves there's nothing forbidden about that but not a permanent change even if the procedure is reversible Etc but at the time the reason you engage in the procedure the medical procedure is to make it permanent at that time so no we don't do the vasectomies again unless it's some sort of other medical thing how to message no alcohol and drugs to teenagers and college kids what is the appropriate age to start the conversation well way before their teenagers and college kids when their teenagers Hollister they're gone as the father of teenagers the minute they hit 14 15 I don't know what happens to them they go somewhere else even though they're in front of you and two years ago they were little but something happens they're they're gone somewhere else so you have to teach these things from when they are born uh you know when the child is born the moment they are born for those first seven eight ten years that's when you infuse them with your values our values so there's no joke with these things alcohol drugs substances uh it's one of the major sins in Islam the prophet saws called it the mother of all sins so we don't want to play around with that there's no room for that in Islam and unfortunately there are many people that have substance abuse problems in our community so and that's a a larger societal problem but for the purposes of the question when we have kids we should tell our kids from the very beginning and I was in um I was in Rome once there was this Catholic Muslim thing and I was that was actually one of the times where I really felt that I don't know about this Interfaith stuff it's worth it stuff a lot maybe I shouldn't say this publicly but we were talking and um one of the Catholic uh guys was talking about secularism and trying to convince me and the other Muslim guys that we need to teach secularism in the Muslim world because I said why would we do that uh as to don't you when you raise your kids don't you teach them Catholic values Christian values I said so you want us to raise our kids to be religion neutral and then they choose what kind of nonsense is that I said we're not going to do that we're going to teach our children Haram and Halal from when they're young now that doesn't disregard we also teach them to coexist with other people why can't we do both but I have an obligation to teach my children to teach my community what's right and what's wrong there are things that are just Haram it's not my religion this is the religion of Allah we are just narrating so you have to have that attitude with your children there's no it's not we're not joking this is not like oh maybe no the Haram is the Haram and the Halal is the Halal so this is one of those things where just we just don't do it when you are very clear like that and your children are very young they're also going to grow up that that's very clear just like when you teach them when they're very young it's okay that there are other people out there that believe in other things then they're also going to grow up thinking that it's okay but if you grow up if you raise them teaching them that Islam is right and everyone else is wrong and then everything in the world is Haram what do they grow up as they grow up as hateful people those are the people now that are persecuting other people in the name of Islam those are the people now that go around and bomb Shia mosques or bomb ahmedi mosque or something like that where do those people come from when they were young someone fed them that garbage so we we will do both we will teach our kids what's right and wrong and we also teach them that we are the people of Mercy that we are the people of coexistence you have your way I have my way but in my way this is how we do it in my house in Mar mosque this is how we pray in our religious life this is what we do and that's fine so when you raise them like that when they're young by the time they're teenagers and they go to the college then they have that Compass they're able to interact with the world around them without being swallowed by the world around them that's Islam it's not one extreme or the other it's not that everything outside is Haram or whatever let's just go with the flow it's neither it says these are my values and I'm going to live in the world with my values and I'm going to interact in the world with my values and I'm not going to adopt those values that are against my values that's what we're after that only comes when you raise them from their very very young foreign this is my favorite question of the entire night what is the correct way to line up for prayer at the mosque if there's a line drawn should the heels be on the line or the toes on the line if some are using chairs where should the back heel of the chairs be placed what part of the chair qualifies for shoulder to shoulder rule if the space between the Imam and the first row is very tight what is the minimum amount of space needed for the Imam to qualify for being ahead of the congregation okay so the reason I laugh is because the other week I mentioned this I think it was aishat prayer it was a long discussion alhamdulillah this is my role at the mosque so let me give you the definitive answer we have these strings in the mosque or if you go into a mosque in their lines you are supposed to place the heel on the line because if you place the heel on the line what is directly above the heel is your shoulder so if you put the heel on a line and the guy next to you or the woman next year and the guy on your left and your right does the same thing that means you are automatically shoulder to shoulder but because our size of our feet are different if you put the toes on the line then you will stand back at different and if you do that by the fourth rock out the line is all zigzagging like that so anatomically Allah created the heels if you stand up straight are right below your shoulders so number one the heels go on the line not the toes I don't know how this Bida started in the mosque we used to do heels on the line and something happened and now everyone went back number two the chairs the chairs should be placed such that if the person sitting in the chair were standing they would be standing also heels on the line now some people that pray in the chair they start standing and then they end up sitting or some people can't even stand and also they sit that's fine that means that they will if if the row of people are standing and then there are some chairs the people in the chairs will look like they're sitting behind the people but they're not because they're feet and their heels are on the line as for the situation with the amen all of them except Malik says that the Imam has to be the one in the front even if it's just by a little bit yeah you know like a few inches but as I have said in this mosque specifically until we move to the activity building we have a problem that there is no maharab here behind me it's just a wall so whoever stands here has to stand back or else your head's going to hit the wall and by default the first row ends up sometimes encroaching on the Imam or if we have overflow out in the library or in the kitchen or outside or or Eid prayer that happens every Aid you will find people praying in front of the Imam so in this mosque we adopt the position of Imam Malik and Imam he said that the Imam being the frontmost person is not a condition for the validity of Prayer I hope that is clear and we don't have to talk about it again until the Bida Creeps in and then people go back to praying with the toes okay actually this is really silly but one Ramadan I think it's Dr Dean who always used to say heels on the line he kept the heels on the line heels online so I actually went home it was one night and Ramadan I went home and I found on godaddyheels on the line.com was available but my son prevented me from buying it I would I wish I did heels of the line.com okay it's such a Muslim thing only a Muslim would do that right of course it's going to be available who's going to buy that URL no exactly like that so you see your heels on so if you stood up so stand up your heels are on the line and then if you sit down then you're gonna be behind everyone but your heels are still next to the person next to you just like that well only if it doesn't cause a problem for the people behind them to see the problem in our mosque is not that the problem is that if you do that the people behind them are not going to be able to make sujud so what ends up happening is the chair is in front so in in our mosque in this Hall specifically we're gonna just let the chair come up front uh yeah it's okay because we have another option because if you do that then the the line behind you can't pray then we lose a line of the men we'll lose a whole line of the men we have to come well you can't really see it from the camera So and I've said that before so the chairs that are here it's okay that they're in the front because technically the Imam standing in the middle here he's not putting his heels on the line he's a few inches up in front anyway so it's okay that the chairs are up because we have no other option there's no other it's we have it's just we have to do that okay if while praying in congregation a child starts crying what is the right etiquette should the parent pick up the child and leave the congregation so that others are not Disturbed and then the parent offers his or her prayer after the congregation or the prayer is over if you're praying with your child and your child cries you can carry your child that's number one or you can start off by carrying your child in the first place so usually when you carry your child your child is quieted and that's fine as for the Imam when the Imam hears that the child is crying that's also an indication for the mm wrap it up so if the Imam knows that there are you know the if let's say I'm leading the prayer or Ennis is leading the prayer because I was pretty short say Ennis is leading the prayer and the kid cries and like a few verses later the kid stops crying so hello just keep you know the Lady or the man picked up the child no big deal but if like five six verses later the the kid is screaming at the top of his lungs you know about to die and his lungs are gonna burst you know but uh just knock out finish the prayers because that's not that we've missed the whole point of the prayer so the parent carry your child that's okay it doesn't invalidate your prayer and the Imam wrap it up if that happens the prophet saws Hussain used to pray uh play on him when he was praying uh and he and there are evidence that he would carry his grandchildren so there's nothing wrong with that thanks if the if the if the situation is so bad and the child like let's say the child had like explosive diarrhea or something like and it's cry yeah the lady's gonna have to get out of the prayer and leave don't just put the prayer kid on the ground with all the crap and then just wait till the prayer ends that's not going to work you have to leave the prayer and then come back of course [Music] you can take a few step less than three consecutive steps so you can take one two pause one two pause one two pause and you can walk across the whole mosque like that but not like one two three four five that would invalidate the prayer that's also extreme rather that's an extreme situation because somebody else will pick up the child yeah I don't know why some parents don't pick up their children maybe they think they're not allowed to yeah no you can pick up you can pray with holding your children any maybe you have if you're an infant you can wear one of those baby braces you know and things like that there are other ways of doing it that's another issue um in some schools eating crab they say is makro what is macro if shellfish and crab and lobsters are allowed macro is disliked meaning that if you leave the disliked ACT you are rewarded but if you engage in the disliked act you receive no sin so it is macro to come inside the mosque after having eaten uh uh onions and garlic it's considered disliked why because your breast smells and everyone's going to smell but it's not Haram so my wife made Biryani for dinner and I can't help myself so I had the Biryani came with the most that's okay but then my wife made Biryani and I said you know what I'm gonna go to the mosque first when I come back so I'll get a reward for leaving something that was makro that's what makro means as far as shellfish and the majority of them are the habits permissible anything that is considered a fish that's from the sea that lives primarily in the sea is halal to eat the issue where this confusion happens is that there are some kinds of crabs that are not like uh uh I forgot what they're called but they're not just they don't live in the water they live outside they look like crabs what are they called sand crabs I think something like that what no alaskans good stuff you know Alaskan lobsters oh that's good stuff because if they just can't live outside the water the stuff that the Fuca had talked about are the things that live outside the water that can't be classified fish but the Hadith is anything in the sea that comes from the sea the in the thick we would say Falls underneath the category of a fish is permissible squid octopus eel uh prawns uh crab Lobster all of that's permissible to eat clams oysters Etc in some schools of thought what do is nullified if a person touches I believe it's member of another sex while in some schools the wudu is not nullified your explanation please this is the opinion the opinion we say that if you touch somebody who's marriageable meaning a non-relative uh like a man and his wife so if I touch my wife or she touched me I would lose my Urdu that's in the Shafi method in the other madahib there are more details you have to touch with uh desire sexual desire Etc by the way he interpreted the Quran and Sunnah as he took the Prima fascia meaning of words so when Allah says in the Quran or you have intercourse with women but the word uses lamasa which is to touch so Imam uses the the immediate Prima facial definition of the word what is the minimum amount of touch touch okay therefore any type of touch would invalidate that's how his that's how his legal School works the other on the map they say no it has to be with desire so on and and so forth so in this so let's say I'm walking I'm coming into the mosque to give the jummah and I'm outside and I'm with my wife and then my wife trips and she grabs my hand okay that moment I'm gonna follow another method I'm not going to come in everyone's waiting for me to come in I'm not going to come in and take all this off and then go to the bathroom and then make will do and everyone's looking at me like what's he doing in the bathroom I'll just follow another method so you can follow another opinion yeah you can either make Ania before or you can do it some of the all of that said you can make and they are retroactive so let's say I was on the phone when I was walking in to the mosque and I was distracted uh and uh I was on the phone with rielle and rielle was just telling me that we got a million dollar donation so I was super excited and I couldn't pay attention and my wife was trying to get my attention and my wife tapped my hand and I wasn't paying attention and I came directly in and I prayed Jomar or whatever whatever I was praying and then after the prayer my wife told me by the way I touched you when we were walking in so this happened in the past so I can say hello then retroactively I will follow the school of email Medic or follow the school of remember so things are flexible foreign [Music] if I want to thank Allah for a special favor I have received or my duys have been answered what prayer should I offer simply turakas anything that you feel uh called to do you should do you could fast you can give donation to the mosque you can pray you can read some Quran anything that that Allah calls you to do because this is something that's personal between you and Allah you are creating a link and a relationship between you and Allah if I'm offering to hejud and I feel tired is it okay to offer two rakas and one raqqa of wit in one standing or should I offer two rakas and say Salem and offer one with her you can do them either way you can do them together all three together or you can then do two Salam salaam and one both or you can pray just one raka which is the minimum amount of winter prayer so it's easy because all of this is Sun in some communities in Asia they recite the Talquin over here in the U.S we rarely do please comment is after we place the body in the grave we somebody uh kneels at the head of the body and calls the person by their name the son of their mother's name and we say the angels are going to come and ask you three questions they're going to ask you what your religion is you say Islam is your religion what your book is you say Quran is your book who is your prophets Muhammad is my Prophet Etc this is called Talquin is to is to say something and have somebody repeat it after you this is a Sunnah and a very important Sunnah we don't do it in America there's a lot of things we don't do in America because people don't know so this is the Sunnah that we revive I think when we do our burials we do the Talquin right don't we do we do it haven't I done it when we do the burials when I'm there the Bida police show up where there's a difference maybe we can have a workshop about the uh the the death process uh maybe in the spring when the weather is not not too bad maybe we can do a a workshop just a couple hours that we can talk about all of these things if we maybe we can get a mannequin then we can we can practice washing and shrouding but in the back because if we do it too close to the main road people are going to think that we're crazy so we have to go the back behind the behind the basketball quarters foreign excellent okay excellent yeah so the talking if I die please someone do the Talquin for me and I'll always promise that if I'm the one there for the burial I'll always do my best to remember to do the tongue clean for you because this is the sun of the prophet sallallahu Mr President here no this is where the Genesis is supposed to take place no the Janessa is as soon as in the mosque why to attract the most amount of people because the more lines in the Janessa prayer the better it is for the person who has passed away so no that's not correct it doesn't have to be outside the physical mosque there's nothing wrong with praying it inside No it should be in the mosque you know proper where the maharab is the where we usually pray because then we can accommodate the most people and also because of the elements outside it might be too hot it might be raining it might be too cold it might be snowing so no it's it's okay to pray inside there's nothing that's where it's supposed to take place sometimes we pray that geneza at the at the grave site because of the time situation the washing took place and you know there's just no time we have to go before dark because sometimes the grave site will only allow us to you know they close at a certain time that's different that's you know a special circumstance but the sun has to do it inside the way we do it inside the mosque alhamdulillah we do a very good job in this mosque with with that alhamdulillah um usually after the geneza visitors visit the family for three day period is three days official morning period yes this is the Sunnah so the taziah is for three days uh and not more so that you don't burden the family so you don't it's not two more else it's like never ending for the family so we do it for three days meaning you don't have to go for three days don't be a squatter but you have those three days to go in and out usually we take food now I think I've mentioned this before we unfortunately it's the opposite where the the family who experienced the death they bring the food and host us it's not how it's supposed to be because it's more of a burden is that we are supposed to go and take them food so that they can just focus on their morning and you know we say something positive to them and he was a good person she was a good person you know this is not the time to go and say do you know that your father was very mean to me and that's not the time to go say that after the three days you can say that I'm just kidding the prophet saws told us to mention Only the Good of our dead may Allah have mercy upon all of them a pregnant woman has a miscarriage in the first few weeks and the fetus passes let's say in the toilet what should be done relating relating to the geneza if there's no screaming if there's no breath from the fetus then there is no genesa so this is just a pre-human being fetus which is tied into our idea of abortion by the way because this has to the same rulings that the soul is placed in the body after 120 days so if the child is born after 120 days and if they're screaming then we do a geneza because we consider it a person before that it's a type of vegetative growth biological growth in which case there is no Genesis foreign usually Muslims bury their dead with a day of passing within a day of passing but some take several days and yet others take weeks to send the body overseas after embalming what practices is best for the soul the way that you honor the dead is to bury them right away that's the Sunnah so in our culture the Muslim culture we bury really quickly I mean somebody who dies in the morning and before matter if they're buried everything they're washed shrouded and buried that's the Sunnah now as a minority Community sometimes that's not the easiest thing because of distances and family members or there's nobody in the mosque or something like that so sometimes it might lag for a day or two that's okay because it's out of necessity there are some other people like the question says that want to take the body and go back home to be buried it's not Haram but I wouldn't recommend that because this is home this is where Allah chose for you to die so the thing is to die here unless I was traveling for work and I like was in New Zealand or something like that and then I died my the legalities is they have to ship me back because I don't live there that's different in that case hello it's just that's your product but if you live here you're a resident here you have a home here a citizen Etc and you die here my advice is to make preparations that you are buried here and take comfort into the prophet sallallahu said whoever dies away from their the Muslim Homeland dies the death of the Martyr even if they are a festival even if they are a corrupt person so there is a great reward for living as a minority community and holding on to our faith and dying here inshallah they say that sadaka is the umbrella within which Zakir and fitra and other forms of Charity reside please clarify are their rules of sadaqah as there are categories which apply to zakah this I smell from this question somebody doesn't want to pay there's a cap one thing and and Zeke is something else is charity charity is anything in excess that you give either material food uh money a smile helping someone all of this is a chair you give from the resources that Allah has given you uh blindly to whoever needs it zakaya is different zakaya is arms that is due on excess wealth that we have that is in our complete possession is over the Nissan amount and has been in our complete possession for one lunar year at that time then we take 2.5 percent of it and we put it in the zakab box that's different as for zakatul fit that's yet another type of zakat that is due on every one of us in the month of Ramadan before we prayed it's about like 10 12 bucks per person so these are three different things is Charity anything that you give from your resources even like smiling or being generous to someone that's a form of sadafa or if you give money to the mosque that's Etc zakaya is more specific it's access livestock excess fruit excess gold and silver excess cash Etc you pay the alms on that and that money is distributed to the categories that are laid out in Surat to tawba is displaying or wearing the evil eye aloud the evil eye it's not the evil eye it's meant to Ward away the evil eye but the eye or the blue or whatever what's all that about we know the dying that the evil eye is a truth the prophet saws it's a truth that somebody can have an evil eye towards you and uh you know a bad energy comes from that person towards you you can give yourself the evil eye by the way too you can be so infatuated with yourself that you give yourself the eye what are all of these things they are usually placed at the entrance of a house or a room to break the person that's coming to visit you's attention so any potential negative energy that they will have which is the evil eye towards you will break so if you walk into go to somebody's door and you knock it and there's this big blue eye what's going to happen you're going to look at the big blue eye so it catched it caught your attention but if you don't have that you knock on the door and the door opens and it's this beautifully clean house and all this beautiful furniture and everyone is so beautiful and the guy people are walking in like that and they're just the evil eyes that's coming out that's how the evil eye can befall you so these things it's not uh Islam thing it's not a Haram and Halal thing this is how Allah has created the universe the evil eye is true it's a negative energy and these things break the negative the energy by catching somebody's attention uh so there is truth in that it doesn't have to be that eye by the way that's just because it's trendy it could be anything I've had somebody who was visiting my house once was not a Muslim but there was some definitely some negative stuff definitely happening and um it's actually this person was Jewish and I you know the the Jews also have the negative I think too and it was like a business thing anyway I was kind of nervous so I didn't I didn't know what to bring I don't I don't have an evil eye at home or I don't have the blue eye so the best I could do is I brought a ladder and I had some paint in the basement so I put the ladder right in the entrance of the house with the paint on my wife of course was very mad how could you do this so ugly I said trust me I know what I'm doing because I don't I don't I you know we have we have to protect I have a bad feeling so when I open the door you know what does she see she sees this you know she went like this I was like whatever whatever it might have been was not so that's what the evil eye and the and the thing is there's another question that came that's related to this so let's jump to that which is what does Islam say about astrology moon phases and what traditions do we have regarding that astrology as far as predicting your future or what's going to happen tomorrow you're going to meet a nice man you're going to need a nice woman all of that's nonsense but astrology as far as your zodiac sign and the qualities that are General in that zodiac sign and you that is true and there are stones that are associated with your zodiac sign so some of the the of they talk about the zodiac sign of the Prophet so the prophet saws was born April 20th so you talk about his zodium his astrological sign and that this character is balanced and and they use this to say oh so he was born with the best of zodiac signs and there are some people that are compatible in that so me and my wife we found out that we are the exact opposite in every single way possible but our zodiac signs are actually the two of the ones that are compatible subhanallah so these things there is a truth to it so if you look at it from that point of view and you wear like a ring or a necklace with the stones that's associated with your sign then like my one of my Stones is the amethyst so the idea is that if you have an amethyst like I have an amethyst I have a cane whose crook is made out of amethyst and the idea is that the sunlight reflects from the stone it kind of gives you a healing energy all of that stuff is we say is the way Allah created the world it's not about belief it's not about Haram it says that I was born in March so this I'm a Pisces and there are certain things in the Pisces uh character that match my my traits so you will find it easier to deal with me if you know that about me and vice versa so there's nothing wrong with that as far as moon phases is concerned uh a little bit different we say that the moon has 28 phases the first 14 phases of the Moon the Moon is growing the growing phases of the moon the 14 phases of the growing Moon correspond to the 14 letters in the Quran that open up the surahs what are those letters you can make a sentence out of them a wise statement that is absolute in it is a secret that's what that sentence means and those letters of that sentence are the 14 letters that open the different chapters and then the remaining 14 phases of the moon when the moon contracts which we are about to enter now they are the the phases uh the other 14 letters of the Arabic letter Arabic alphabet and then of course the three main uh the three days of the middle of the month when the moon is the fullest the 13th the 14th and the 15th of the lunar month those are the Sunnah days to fast and there is some kind of correspondence with the full moon and fasting so there's a little bit of literature about that but as far as predicting the future and that's just like fortune cookie stuff that's not true so we don't believe in that but we can look at it from the ways that I mentioned of course many people will listen to what I just said and say that I'm a cafe that's they can come and talk to me afterwards and we can sort that out um if I want to make Dua in Salah can we make it in English of course the prophet saws said the closest the person is to Allah is when they are in sujood so this is the time for Dua so if you make Dua Allah understands alhamdulillah all languages you can't read the Quran in English in prayer that's different because that's a it's a liturgy but you can make the Dua it's like in suju that's fine I was wondering if saving my baby's umbilical cord to use for stem cell therapy is halal a little background my father-in-law is receiving stem cell therapy to possibly helps slow his ala well without the background that's fine it's preserving the umbilical cord for stem cell therapy is there's nothing wrong with that and there are services that provide that for people foreign are there any questions online no if you combine Madrid with Aisha with the intention to delay to pray with Aisha then the prayer is not it's that means that you have prayed it it on time why because you have intended to delay it which is permissible if you just miss the prayer and you forget all together and then you pray it that's when it's a makeup prayer uh it's soon not to pray Aid outside I'm not I'm not genoza I'm not registering that it's a sun Enterprise I think the Genesis took place in the prophet saws I can look that up but what's registering for me is that the Sunnah is to pray that outside really okay I'll look that up maybe there's a Sunday night I mean I've I'm not right it's not registering which doesn't mean anything it just means it's something I don't know let me look it up okay does anyone here have a question numerology is for us is the association of the numbers with the Arabic alphabet so that's another discipline and it's called al-hat and there's a Hadith that the prophet saws said there used to be a prophet who did that meaning and whoever's Hut matches his they were they were correct so there is evidence in the Hadith for that and that is that the Arabic alphabet not written not written like that but how was it has a different order not exactly sure where that order came from but this is the order that we've inherited that each line of 10 letters the first line each letter gets one to ten in the second line 20 30 40 all the way I think to 100 and then the third line it starts at 200 and it goes up by 100 to a thousand and then that way every letter has a numeric value what's the benefit of that well the benefit of that is that sometimes in vic when you make Allah's Divine names and you invoke a particular name with the same value number of times with its numeric value it will have a stronger impact on you so as you know one of the things that I always teach you is a motif Allah's name Latif or the subtle one the numeric value of the Lamb is 129. so when people are overwhelmed or anxious or not feeling well they can invoke Allah's name 129 times why 129 times because that's the value of the number of the of the of the word some people will take the number and square it so 129 squared which some huge number and they'll do the thicken that way which is massive what is 129 Square it's a lot that's like my answer you can't that's not the right 16 641. so in some books they will say if you're really you're really in Dire Straits then mention the word the name Latif sixteen thousand six hundred and forty one so um let's say you know there's uh a big Calamity you know God forbid in our community or something like that so we'll we'll all get together one night and after ashat prayer we'll all together we'll we'll do 16 641 up until you know fed your time for Allah to relieve This calamity things like that so these things have these things happen so the numerology from that point of view and that is the extent of what I know about the new the numerology or what is useful of course there's a lot of play the name of surahs and the number and then your numeric value and all that kind of stuff but I mean you it can become I don't want to say pointless but it could become uh non-beneficial when you start to look at all of those permutations but that's what that science of numerology is for us because there's truth in those things but that's too much because it's not a precise science so I'm a Pisces so whatever the general character traits of the Pisces maybe eight out of ten you'll find in my personality but 20 you won't I'm just different so it can't predict oh we have to do the the at this time because Mercury is falling and I don't know Jupiter is rising it no that's that's what we don't do but for us we look at the we look at the zodiac sign okay what is your sign then there are some features that are you know with this person but you might be attracted to another person for marriage and they might be the the same zodiac sign so we won't say oh that's a bad match because it's not precise yeah that's what's Haram that's what's Haram for us to predict the future based on that we use it to understand our personality some healing stones or minerals uh in the case of of that um that's that's about it same thing it's the same concept it's to capture someone's attention away from looking at you so you don't want somebody to give you hasn't so when you come to your house maybe outside of the door you put you know something so it's the same idea the eye the idea behind the eye is that it's blue and black and it's just it's worth it and you have to you're gonna your eye will naturally go to it so it will take away whatever energy is there that's just the idea behind it it's really no more no less than that and it's real that the evil eye thing is real I mean it happens I have seen it happen I'm sure of all of you have seen it too I've had people come to the house and leave a tree fell on the roof I mean I've seen that you know I was like oh no that doesn't need any thinking I know what happened there so that stuff can happen and these are simple ways that we can protect ourselves from it thank you so he's asking about voting for a political party you vote for a specific party a Democrat or a Republican and then the person you vote for goes and does you know whatever something crazy are you responsible for that no because no one is running to say that they're going to do bad things so you know you have no choice but to take them at face value but you must know that all politicians by default are liars so I hate to tell you that but you have to also be not naive they're going to say whatever they'll say to be elected whether they're a Muslim politician non-muslim politician this country anything that's just the nature of politics whatever is going to help me right now get to power I'm going to say which is why as I've said to you before I don't vote and I am very adamant about that because I believe that people in my place whether Muslim Christian Jewish Hindu whatever need to service the entire community so I can't be I can't take Islam and put it and say oh the Democratic ticket is Islam or the Republican ticket is Islam it's neither Islam is above all of that so you all should vote you should vote for who you think is the best candidate uh knowing that Yani the pickings are Aslan very bad and you know we ask Allah I hope tonight goes well with the elections and you know who knows what's going to happen but we hope that it goes well and whoever is elected in this state Governor whatever or to the Senate we hope that Allah guides them and and they do what's best for the country we also ask Allah to give Victory to the Pakistani cricket team as they play in the semi-finals tonight inshallah okay India oh I'm sorry oh about it are there Muslims in the Indian team okay may the best man win [Music] if you're praying alone at home you should be audible to yourself uh yeah but you can't say hello Akbar and and and and just say it in your mind you have to actually sound out the fat to have for example just so that you can hear it the ear for either prayer so even if it's for the Fajr uh it would be louder but even for the NASA you have to be audible to yourself you have to enunciate the words exactly no no just you can hear it yeah unless you're trying to wake up the people in your house to let them know you're praying that's a different then you can be louder but yeah it's just enough that you can hear anybody else have any questions [Music] oh okay what other questions a reliable information on zodiac signs I don't know I just asked my wife so I I don't know that's a good question I don't think she but I just asked her can you recite the Quran when you don't have Voodoo absolutely you don't have to have to recite the Quran can you touch the musaf and read from the must-have when you don't have wudu there's a difference of opinion the opinion that I encourage people to follow is the opinion of IBN hazam from the zahiri school that you do not have to have wudu to touch the Muslim why even though the majority of the say the opposite because I don't want there to be a situation and when someone feels that they don't want to have a relationship with the Quran because if you say oh I want to go read the Quran oh I don't have what do you know what I'm just not going to read the Quran then that we've created a situation that's not good so we can follow that opinion what happens if if you are in a state of Geneva either you've a woman has her monthly cycle or you have a uh uh you've had sexual intercourse or something like that in that case you have to make Russell before you recite the Quran what does recite the Quran mean that's the issue recite the Quran is to say out loud that's reciting the Quran but if I say the Quran in my mind and I'm silent that's not considered reciting the Quran or if I say my vicar that I say in the morning in the evening and in my thicker are verses of the Quran that's not considered reciting the Quran so reciting the Quran is to enunciate out loud that you have to you cannot be in a state of Geneva for you have to be in a state or you have to remove the Geneva by making can you touch the Muslim you are in a state of Geneva no in that case if you read from your phone or iPad then this is not considered the what's the definition of the musaf the definition of the musaf is all of the verses written in the authmatic script beginning with the fat ending in Surat and Ness in one volume that's the technical definition of the most so if I have you know like those sets that they have 30s different just that's not one of those drills is not considered all of that together is the Muslim or if you have a book of tafsir that's not the most half because it's a commentary on the Quran so if the Quran that's on your phone this is not considered the musaf even though the app has all of the Quran by the technical definition so if I was in a state of Geneva or if a woman had her cycle and she was trying to review something she could look at it from her phone and review it without sounding it out loud that would be fine so go ahead are we supposed to pray I already prayed I should we still actually still we haven't prayed yet in the mosque okay 8 30. okay let's we'll wrap up quickly meaning the sun hasn't the grandson hasn't married oh he had an illegitimate child ah well unfortunately in the Sharia uh if you have a child out of wedlock the child cannot be connected through lineage to the father and this is one of the I know the tough I've always had a problem with this I remember we were studying so if there's if there's a mayor if there's a sexual relationship outside of marriage and the woman uh gives birth in the Sharia that man cannot claim to be that child's father that's the severity of of of of of illicit relationships so there is no relationship from that point of view he will be the son of that that woman what would you like and they are praying but they are asking finding good if you have a hard time finding motivation I would contemplate your own more more mortality to close your eyes every night before you sleep and to imagine that this is it you're gonna sleep and not wake up the woman can lead the prayer with playing with kids if the kids are small yes to be able to teach them that's fine anything else I should have brought the iPad betrayal and heartbreak uh the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he said the person who falls in love hides that love because there's something preventing them from expressing that maybe I fall in love with a married woman and hides that love and and Deals appropriately with those feelings and dies they die as a martyr so the person who carries heartbreak and is uh adult enough to hold on to that and to know that the reward is with Allah this will lead them to the paradise so we have to remember that it's this life and the hereafter many of us go through heartbreak many of us lose people maybe many of us fall in love with the wrong person or illicitly or something like that uh but we have to remember this Hadith and remember that the Allah the prophet saws and that Allah says I am with the Brokenhearted so the person whose heart is broken who's going through that trauma that is where Allah is because you're most vulnerable so for you the object is to turn to Allah not to turn to something else to heal yourself but know that that raw moment of absolute raw emotion and you're you're completely debased Allah has debased you so that you turn to him and to him alone and then you can turn that low into the greatest High foreign
