okay so i'm going to first read the questions that i've received and then we can talk about uh if there are other questions people want to ask the questioner asks i'm about to get married and wanted to ask my future husband that he takes me to hajj as my mother is that valid or only money can be set as a model no that's valid it can be anything that you agree on it could be a service it could be cash so that's fine i have a question regarding zakar on company pension funds the situation is that i have a pension with a company that is not accessible until retirement which in my case will be in about 10 to 12 years the second point is that my income is insufficient to pay zakah on the pension it would be a significant portion of my income what is the ruling for zakah on these kind of pension funds if i'm not mistaken we have this question last session but in general because exactly what you stated there is no zakah on the pension funds on the retirement funds because it it omits a key aspect of zakker a a precondition of paying zakay is that you have complete ownership you have complete ownership of that money because the money is invested in your name and for your benefit in the future but it is shielded by this uh instrument the pension or the 401k or the roth or whatever the ira or whatever the instrument is called it is shielded from you and you cannot access it freely complete ownership means i can grab it pick it up you know and put it in my pocket or i can decide to put it in this pie i own it i can do whatever i want with it so these type of investments uh or these type of retirement funds there's no zakat on them i wrote an article about this on my website understanding uh thoughts on zakam in which i lay out the the various scenarios for the pension funds but in retirement accounts uh particularly american retirement accounts there is or you know any retirement account for that matter there will be no zakah on it until that money comes into your complete possession which would probably be after the age of retirement and then even after the age of retirement the money is still being invested so in the article i also talked about how you will deal with paying zakah on that asset after the retirement age until what age or stage of life must a woman wear hijab the prophet sallam said that when a woman become is mature and becomes of age after she reaches the age of puberty that which she shows in public is her face and her hands and then the hanifa and the hainafi's add in her feet so this is just a general thing that when a woman is of age uh and she's out in public or with people that are not her close relatives that she covers and just like the man also has parts of his body that he has to cover so this is not something that's necessarily age restricted that it stops at a certain age it's something that we continue unless we're talking about somebody who's very old or you know end stage of their life and they don't go out of their house anyway then at that point that obligation could could be lifted but that's sort of when somebody is at the end of their life and and as i said not leaving their house can the elderly loved ones of the opposite gender i don't know if i should answer that question and i think i should leave people to to do what they know is right we are an affectionate community at iccp alhamdulillah and that's a good thing and part of that is that we we express our our affection towards one another in various ways like me getting up at 2 30 in the morning 2 45 in the morning to do this with you this is my way of expressing my affection to you um but in general we know that there are certain limits of of gender interactions and uh we need to make sure that we're always within those within those limits but i don't think there's really a need to get into the details of answering that lest we make something that is permissible and we make it into something that is haram when going on when does one make the intention and dress in for example if we have a flight to jeddah that stops in turkey do we get dressed at the airport in istanbul and then make tel be in the air in route to jeddah could you please go over a few scenarios that would be acceptable in terms of intention and okay so around around the uh city of mecca there are different points on the map that the prophet sasalam indicated for us that are called al-mikhat al-mikhat are geographic locations that if you connected them they would make this you know very weird shape around mecca and or around arabia actually and depending on where you are coming from if you are coming from the east or from the west or the north or the south once you get to that point that's where if you're a man you need to take off your normal clothes and put on the ahram clothes and for women of course they just wear their normal clothes and it's at that point that you have to have the intention to enter into the state of ahram so usually when you're flying in uh to make omra or to make hajj usually the captain of the plane will tell you we are going to pass the mirkat in you know five minutes or ten minutes or something like that so in this scenario if you are traveling from istanbul it would be wise that you take that leg of the flight dressed in your clothes now istanbul is definitely past the mikhat i mean you could make your home from washington dc because it's very far away but then it could be you know uncomfortable so in this scenario if you're flying i'm assuming from america and then you get to europe or you get to istanbul or a place like that you can put on your haram clothes and then you can wait on the plane until the captain says we are about to pass the mirkata and at that point you can make the intention or you can make the intention right there in the airport in istanbul it's fine the mirkat is the last point at which you need to make the make the intention to enter into the state of iran so um that's fine you know people that come from cairo or people that come from amen or people that come from you know damascus or people that come from baghdad these type of cities istanbul i guess there are probably it's a common flight it's very common that you'll see people on those flights wearing for this reason when burying a person people like to place the body or with the body a piece of the covering of the kaaba they have preserved is this okay yes it's permissible to bury um sacred objects or special objects with people there's nothing wrong with that um especially if there are people uh like the alameda some of the alumni they'll be buried with their you know their turban or with their jubba or their cloak you know we've read about that so as long as the body has been washed properly and has been shrouded properly with the white you know linen shroud the caffeine it's okay that those things can be added for barakah sometimes people are buried with you know if they possess a hair of the prophet or an article of clothing that was uh that belonged to their teacher or to a pious person those types of things are permissible people sorry there's i when i printed it out i printed them all together so i have to sometimes differentiate people like to keep some flowers by the graveside on the grave when visiting a grave they feel happy doing this is this okay it's not about how we feel it's about what what does the quran and the sunnah teach us about the act the prophet saw sallam uh was walking by a grave and this hadith is narrated in bukhari and he said oh these two people he walked by two great these two people are being punished in their graves but not for something big one of them did not wash themselves properly after relieving themselves and the other person used to backbite so the prophet saws ordered that a palm leaf a leaf of a palm tree be planted near the grave and the prophet saw said as long as this is alive this leaf or is alive this will serve as a lessening of their punishment and forgiveness for them so based on this hadith the ulum differed on this issue so it would indicate that what the sunnah is if we were to follow the opinion that it's permissible to do that is to plant something green by the grave the flowers is a more of a western expression of as the questioner said it makes you feel good the living but what we want to do is we want to do something that will help the deceased so a good practice for us would be is to be plants greenery um you know most of our graveyards grasses around there anywhere anyway to to start out with but to plant plant something that is green i mean of course we don't have date or palm trees where we live but to plant something green that would be the route to go and that's what i advise and if you come to certain part like in here in egypt if you go to some of the older graves you will find families of the disease will have planted you know greenery around the graves based on this hadith and other narrations of that hadith so there's room for that so let's make it something green not necessarily the flowers when it comes to people that die by the way because this is a second question about death it's important that we remember it's not just how we feel yet we mourn the loss of our loved ones that's natural allah created us that way we also want to make sure that we do what benefits the person that has passed so let our sadness and the difficulty of getting over the loss of a loved one trigger for us a thought of how we can help them maybe we can donate something in their name as a type of sadaqa maybe we can give to the mosque in their name maybe we can help an orphan in their name so on and so forth that's going to help that person that you love and and add you know huge add hugely to their scale of good deeds and at the same time you feel that you are doing something for them so when it comes to death we want to remember that it's not just making ourselves feel good but it's also helping the person who has been deceased what is the practice in delivering the khudba the first part and second part what was the sunnah well before jummah and the khudba for the prayer and the for the eclipse prayer and any time there's a khudba it's the same that there are two khudbas the beginning khudba or the first khudba is usually called the khutba of admonishment that's where the message of the khudba is and it it's preceded by the introduction to the alhamdulillah etc you know what i do in the drama prayer this is this comes from a hadith of the prophet saw that he used to teach the sahaba the introductory supplication of the frequently to the sahaba this is the same thing that we say for example in the khutba that we do when somebody gets married for example so the khudba is preceded by that opening and then the khatib sits for a moment and then stands and then the second khudba the majority of it is dua it's called khudbatun and anat in the arabic language is an adjective and that is a sifa is an adjective and in that the reason they call it that is that you are praising allah subhanahu wa ta'ala with that with those adjectives that are becoming of him which is a metaphor for dua so the second is the dua and that's it and hopefully the khutbas are not too long and hopefully they inspire the people that are listening when the imam is delivering the khutba some people get up and pray their sunnah or others other prayers i find this getting in the way of those who are intensely listening to the sermon could they not go to a quiet corner and do the rakaas if they must well this issue is is a debated issue in the fil and it's not about getting up it's about if you enter the mosque while the is speaking do you pray the two raka's to greet the mosque or do you sit and listen to the difference of opinion and both sides use the same exact hadith as a proof imam shafer he looks to the hadith it's the hadith is called hadith it's founded in bukhari sulak was a sahabi of the prophet salem he walked into the mosque on friday late and he sat down the prophet saws was delivering the khutbah and then the prophet saw him stop the khudban he said sulek why don't you stand and greet the mosque so sulaika stood he prayed the two raka's and then sat back down again remember shafi's says based on that hadith clearly this what you're supposed to do is that if you enter the mosque on friday and the khatib is giving the khudba you pray the two raka's to greet the mosque quickly and then you sit imam malik he said the exact opposite citing the same hadith and imam malik said suleikh was a poor companion who lived on the outskirts of medina and he only came to town on fridays so that he could meet with the other sahaba and and hopefully people would help him out financially or with food on that particular day he came late so out of mercy for him the prophet saws in his in this clever way made him stand so that everybody could see him so imamic he reads the hadith of something being specific only to this instance only to sulaik whereas imam shafi takes the general meaning of the hadith so that's why there's a difference of opinion so you can follow which other whichever opinion is more most compatible to your circumstance when i go come to the mosque late because i'm a chef i will always i hope unless i forget for some reason i will always stand and pray the two raka's because that's the opinion that i follow that being said you're not you're not meant to you know trample on people and to pray the the sunnah because at the end of the day those two are sunnah it's not something that's obligatory so even if that's my opinion and i sit down there's no sin involved in that so in all circumstances when it comes to the mosque when it comes to congregational prayer it's very important that people uh are mindful of other people in the mosque people that are like in this case i mean the point of the you listen to it obviously so you have to be mindful of that make the make the prayer short find an empty part of the mosque if you can and if you can't if there's no empty part in the mosque you probably are just going to sit down then in that case because you're not able really to carry out that sunnah in the first place because the mosque is so crowded in some communities the imam recites the fatah and after amin after saying amin goes quiet to allow individuals to recite the fatah this happens this seems to happen amongst communities that follow imam sheffer your take that is correct in the sha'a madhab it is a integral part of the prayer that every single person recite the fatah the the leader of the prayer the imam and the followers so as a chef if i'm leading the prayer because that's my you know school of thought or that's the opinion that we follow after i finished the fatiha i would pause a little bit to give people the opportunity to recite the fatah of course following that same opinion let's say that the imam doesn't do that or the imam's pause is not long enough if you're a shafai you're still going to recite the faith even if the imam has gone on to another surah even if the imam has gone into rukua you're going to finish your faith and you'll catch up you won't lag behind too far because that's an integral part because imam ishefa imam ishaifah he tends to take the literal meaning of hadith unless there's a need to take a metaphorical meeting so when the prophet saw him said that there is no prayer for the one who has not begun with um kitab or the fatiha imam mashifah takes that to literally mean every single person needs to recite the fatah had every rakah for the prayer to be valid this has to do with us and how the tools of interpretation that the imams use to interpret the quran and sunnah they'll yield different opinions with the imam recites al-fatah and the surah he is doing so on behalf of and for the congregation should we not simply listen and ingest what is being recited well i think maybe this is part of the previous question that's that's the view of imam abu hanifah again it's it's about a tool set of interpreting the quran so there's a hadith that says there is no prayer for the one who does not recite the fatah okay so what does that mean that's the issue the issue is we all all the imams agree with all of that no one says oh this is not a hadith it's all the same hadith how do you apply this hadith is this hadith literal is this hadith metaphorical is this hadith for only the imam is this hadith contingent on something else so on and so forth there's many many different sub-questions that can be asked so because of the differences of how the imams interpret the quran that's why we have different opinions so as long as we are following a valid opinion uh we don't all have to follow the same opinion okay and that's something that we need to just be comfortable with because that's how our faith is there's not just one answer all the time for all of these things so as long as there's a valid difference of opinion it's permissible for you to follow whichever permission opinion you're used to or is more compatible to your circumstance but what you don't want to do is you don't want to say oh this opinion is better than this opinion isn't it better that people do this than no this is one opinion this is another and as i said let's say i'm a shepherd and the imam finishes the fatah and then he starts i'm not going to recite the fatah so loud that i make noise for the people next to me i also have to be mindful of that just like the two raka's that we talked about earlier we are glad that iccp has the practice of preceding joma with the recital many of us come early to listen to this this does not happen in many of the messages i know of i consider this a good practice it prevents people seated from talking to each other waiting for the imam to arrive and helps to create a spiritual environment brother enes does a terrific job i hope this continues well i hope so too inshallah because listening to the quran is a sunnah and the prophet saws used to ask different companions particularly those who had beautiful voices to recite the quran so he could listen to it so i mean it's a sunnah to do that and because we are all in the mosque on friday gathered it's a good use of our time or else people are going to be chit-chatting or you know on their phones or something like that so it's a great sunnah and i also hope that it continues alhamdulillah allah has blessed us with this community without doubt okay can zakar be given to interfaith activities under the zakir rule on the basis that it helps to promote islam no that's that would be too much of a stretch um as i've mentioned in the past and by the way this is also in the article i wrote on zakker there are i think three or four main points i bring up this is one of them in the categories of zakker fisabilillah usually is understood as jihad but the self differed on whether that is limited to literally armed conflict you know legitimate armed conflict or we could add to that other forms of jihad with the tongue is it just as that's how the the phraseology that imam raza uses in his tafsir so the sun the south debated this issue and some of them said no it could be other forms in which we we need to protect our faith and the survival of our faith is is contingent on that i i would not argue or i would find it very difficult to argue that interfaith activities have interfaith is more of a extra thing so we that's something that we do from charity not from zakam because the point is that zach has to help actual people okay can they be used for teaching of the quran in addressa that's closer to the mark if you follow the opinion that it can let's say this is the only center the only place where people in this area can learn quran or learn islam and if it were not for the center then you know our children would lose their faith and if it's something at that level then yes following that opinion oh there's more zakay questions okay can zakat can be used to help a person who is thinking of embracing islam and wishes to go and study islam at an institution if they were in need of that if they were poor or uh poor or needy not just here's a scholarship from the camera to go study islam the simply wearing a headscarf qualifies hijab what is the reason that catholics wear headscarves in church well the catholic thing i think also has changed since since vatican ii in the 1960s so i don't know if they necessarily where cover their head anymore in church but the covering of the head for both men and for both or both women has always traditionally been a sign of modesty so it's not um it's not something unique necessary necessarily to islam that there's this concept of of covering your head in certain instances in certain moments the exact reason why i don't know and i have to i have to look that up as forward as simply wearing a headscarf qualifies hijab yeah what else does hijab mean so again like the hugging question i wouldn't delve into that too much because i don't want to make something that is permissible end up being haram so i think we all know what the hijab is and that's what the hijab is there's not much to say about that other than that i am thinking of proposing to a young lady at college and spending time talking to her my parents from south asia are not happy about this and are giving me the looks they say when they got married they hardly met or spoke to the spouse before marriage please advise what is sunna and what is practical in these times no you have to for people like us you have to go out and understand who this person is that you're going to marry because you're going to live with this person and inshaallah you're going to form a family with this person so um you can't marry somebody that you don't know or you don't or or you haven't seen um the prophet saws told the sahabah you know go look to the man go look at her and see if that's what you want and vice versa when the prophet saws advised women he said if if a man comes to you that has good that has good character and marry him well how do you know if he has good akhlafandeen if you don't get to know that person it's not just like they appear miraculously and it's like written all over them they have good you don't know so i mean these things when you take those hadith and apply them but this is applying the hadith you have to find out so you have to you have to look it's permissible to look it's permissible to talk and you know you're forming a family for god's sake so you want to make sure that that this is somebody that you can form a family with as far as other cultures and other other traditions i'm not going to say that they're neces they're not they're not wrong but they're not compatible for our culture and our and that's something that's cultural it has nothing to do with a monolithic view of religion it's a cultural expression of aspects of the religion so what we don't want to do is we don't want to mix the culture for the religion religion is something that is clearly established from the quran and from the sunnah and the interpretation of the quran and the sunnah in time by the imams by through the process of israel that's what our religion is so we have to take that and then we have to apply it to our time and place and circumstance in a way that is compatible that doesn't violate both the letter of the law and the spirit of the law so speaking to somebody of the opposite sex for the purpose of marriage or looking at the person of opposite sex for the purposes of marriage this is something that is from the dean that the prophet saws told us to do this so if your parents object because that's not how they got married you know that's their that's their culture that they came from you have to explain to them that this is a different culture that is compatible with islam you can blame me you can say i said this so on and so forth so there's nothing nothing wrong with that as a matter of fact i'm dealing with a situation not in this community but somebody who who did he did just that what your parents are telling you to do and he married somebody from a completely different culture he himself was a convert and he had never seen her never it was and it has been an absolute disaster it has been and it's one of the nastiest things i have seen so that can lead to a lot of problems and who that's not the the purpose of marriage clearly that's not the purpose of marriage thanksgiving and islam and christmas celebration if not respect and wishing our christian friends your perspective okay well there's a lot in that little sentence let's unpack that so there are difference there's a difference between civic holidays and religious holidays civic holidays thanksgiving labor day memorial day fourth of july um i mean i would throw halloween in there as well sort of those civ well let's park halloween because people will get mad so let's let's park halloween for a second but all the other things that i mentioned those are civic holidays the prophet saws engaged in civic holidays this comes from the hadith called the hadith of was a pre-islamic commemoration of a war that the austin the khazraj fought in medina and when the prophet sasam came to medina and he participated in the celebration of the day of baal so baath that hadith as a concept means the participation or the permissibility of engaging in the in the celebration of civic holidays so civic holidays are things that that all people in our country do because this is like what americans do on these days or this is what french people do on these days or this is what british people do on these days there's no act of worship or theology behind it we find theological meanings in them and people of different sects of different religions might do something special on those days but that's not the origin of those days the origin of thanksgiving was president lincoln if i'm not mistaken you making this the last thursday or whatever of november a day of national thanksgiving as a way to try to turn the tide of the civil war for example so this is it's not rooted in like some kind of revelation or something like that so those civ civic holidays are things that we are supposed to participate in because we are part of the same civic unit so it would be very odd uh for example on thanksgiving if everyone's participating in thanksgiving and we're just sitting at home doing nothing that would be odd like what's wrong with you like what this is a day that everyone is off schools are off work is off it's a federal holiday and it's a time and we have our own tradition we have the thanksgiving that we do in the mosque and and what not so it's it's something that we're supposed to do in a way i'm not going to say it's a far but it's definitely a sunnah now when it comes to uh religious holidays in which it is part of a religious tradition in which which it is in which there is a theology or there is a acts of worship that are involved that we need to be we need to be careful in we are not allowed to engage in other acts of worship that do not belong to islam so i can't go to a temple and prostrate or go to a church and prostrate or take communion or something like that because those are considered acts of worship i can go as a guest i can go and observe if i have non-muslim family or if i have neighbors or if i'm invited to christening or baptism or whatever the case may be as a neighbor you can go but not participate when it comes to wishing non-muslims holiday greetings in their holidays there's also evidence for that in the sunnah and it's not it's not haram but when it comes to things like christmas specifically and passover and uh yom kippur these are actually days and events that we commemorate because they are in the quran or in the hadith tradition the prophet or allah allah says about christ upon me the day i was born christmas is the celebration for christ so it's also important that on those days the day of ashura that we commemorate um which would be the equivalent i guess of film kippur or the passover in which is mentioned in the quran about beni israel being saved from firaoun under the leadership of siddha musa and his brother these are all things that we have in our tradition and in our stories so there's also an added value in us reminding ourselves of that and then if we engage with our non-muslim neighbors or friends or family that we also mentioned that we have these days as well so if allah himself mentions the day in which christ is born it's clearly a day that's important so it would make sense that on you know every christmas there'd be some akhba dedicated to this topic or every time we have ashura we we remind ourselves of this so on and so forth then so that's not engaging in in another religion's form of worship or anything like that but it's commemorating that which allah himself has commemorated okay i hope that was clear are celebrating birthdays haram as this may be controversial halloween so the reason i the reason i put halloween to the side is that halloween is also it does have some roots that are on islamic but those roots and those origins go back so far that the halloween that we engage in you know kids putting on costumes and going to their neighbors has really nothing to do with that and i think that the the separation between the two uh is so large that i would i interpret it as a civic holiday um i am not for however other cultures doing the halloween things which for some reason in the muslim world it's it's like an increasing type of thing halloween i don't think it's an issue of haram and it's just it's a very it's very american thing i think and it makes sense in america it's a way that the community gets together you know you go out with the kids you meet the neighbors the kids go out together you know the parents talk with one another it's sort of like a it's like a you know neighborhood thing that's what it's really meant to be if it's if it's in that if it's in that sort of understanding particularly as americans i see no nothing wrong with it and i'm when the kids were younger i used to go out with them and i remember one time i went out with the kids and we came across some other kids from iccp and then they were older and they're like oh my god that's the imam you know so for them it was like okay we must be okay so sometimes those things are important you know for people like me to go out as well so the kids don't think that they're doing something wrong or they're kind of like schizophrenic like they have one life here and one life there um so halloween is is one of those things that i also think of as like a civic thing in the american context are celebrating birthdays haram as this may be controversial celebrating is a haram is haram is merely just saying texting somebody happy birthday haram no celebrating the birthday is not haram the prophet saw celebrated his birthday he was asked why he fast on monday he said this is a day in which i was born so the prophet saws i'm fasted every monday not once a year but every monday as a way of commemorating in which he was born the sahabah also commemorated and acknowledged the birth of the prophet saws as being a celebratory act and that evolved into the full-blown mounted celebration that really comes i think in like the third or the fourth century of the hijra so we celebrate the birth of the prophet isalam we celebrate the birth of the pious as as days in which allah has honored us and bless us with this certain person and by extension it's a it's it's there's nothing wrong with celebrating and honoring and acknowledging the passage of your birthday so why don't we add to it some of our own traditions so why don't we make the effort to learn when our hijri birthday is so that we can keep both the hijri birthday and the solar birthday and why don't we think of it as an opportunity to give thanks to allah for extending life to us and extending family to us and so on and so forth so it's a time of reflection so it's like the flowers at the grave there's nothing in and of itself just sort of the way it is that is wrong but what i want us to do is i want us to convert these acts into acts that are more organic with our paradigm and add to it our meanings and our traditions abraham with his soldiers and camels came to invade the kaaba they captured 200 camels of abdul muttalib the grandfather of the prophet salem abdul muttalib was not in a post thing to fight and he sent the message to abraham that allah will protect the kaaba okay this is true my question is though all people that time were worshiping idols and the kaaba was full of idols was abdul muttalib worshiping no we believe that all of the parents and grandparents ascending all of them of the prophet al-salem were all monotheists and allah says in the quran and we have caused your genetic material to transfer from one pious person to another from one pious couple to another pious ka sajidin those who make sujud so this hadith is a reference of the pure nature of the entire lineage of the prophet isaiah going back to adam and this is a a article of belief and a teaching that most muslims forget about that the prophet saw neither his father neither his grandfather or his great-grandfather worshiped idols or worshipped other than allah actually in the hadith in which you are quoting about the story of abraham he says he says to the invading abraham that allah will protect the kaab or the the ka'ba rather has a lord has a rabb that will protect it i believe that's sort of how it was phrased so no we believe that they were monotheists and they did they did not ever prostrate to an idol ever which would also mean therefore the same applies to abraham alaihissalam because abraham and his son ismail these are the direct ancestors of the prophet alaih so then what do we do about the verse in which abraham talks to his father and azar for example about the idols so the mufassirun when they look at that verse in light of this teaching in light of this article of belief they interpreted that the verse differently and they say oh this is a reference to abraham's uncle not his direct father and he was calling his uncle father as a term of endearment okay while taking will do is it okay to wipe over your feet with hands with water if one knows your feet are clean or do you have to immerse your feet in the water up to the ankle in order to make you accept it for the salah again this goes back to how the the quran and sun is interpreted in the in the shafi medhab well first of all you don't have to immerse your foot ever it's about whether you need to pour the water over your foot or if your hand is wet can you wipe over it so that's why there are differences of opinions but the bottom line is yes that's fine as long as your entire foot from your toes up until slightly above your ankle gets wet uh whether it's by your hand or whether it's by like a cloth or whether you're pouring uh or it's coming out of the faucet all of that is fine for the wudu okay i believe this is the last question not from the typed questions can you please explain to hatred prayers as how to pray three rakaas could one pray three rakaas like merib standing for first raka and then sitting for the next two or should you stand for the first two raka's and then sit for the third i know i have explained this before but please bear with us one more time i think you mean with the prayer not the hatred prayer the witted prayer so the witted prayer is the last prayer of the night and it is meant to be an odd prayer meaning that it's an odd number of rakahs the least amount of witted prayer is one raka so you can let's say you pray aisha prayer the mosque salaam salaam you can stand and pray only one rakah and that will be your with it for the night okay so that's one thing i want people to remember is that the least amount of width because one is an odd number so the least amount of width of prayer is is one rakah if you want to pray the three raka witter you can do it different ways you can pray two and then one the way we pray in the mosque in ramadan for example we pray two salam salam and then we pray witar or sorry one raka by itself and then we make the dua i mean the dua is because it's in ramadan so you can do two or one or you can pray it exactly like prayer so you pray three can you know consecutive raka's and you sit for the shahood in the second one and then you should sit for the shout in the final one so either one either way you can do that so i think i hope that that's clear oh somebody said how do i calculate my zakama i this must be must have been a comment related to the zakir question in the beginning so just to go back to that question we're saying uh about the pension fund so you have you have some type of pension in instrument it's like a 401k or an ira or a roth ira or i don't know whatever whatever else is out there or you work for the government you have a pension fund from the point of view of the sharia you do not have complete ownership of this account you have partial ownership the proof is that if you take a withdrawal before the retirement age you are going to pay a penalty and you will subject yourself to extra income tax that is exactly what the sharia means well you don't it's not like money in the drawer that you have this has been laying around for a year that's the money that you pay this account on so the retirement account as a concept is a basic concept you're not going to pay any account at all you're going to start thinking about zakam when you hit the age of retirement and then you have to take a withdrawal and then that money comes to you into your account and even then you have to see if the money is going to be used for expenses or not used for trust let me just pull up the article i wrote because if i'm not mistaken this came up last session or the session before so it's still on people's minds so i actually took the time just to write it's a very uh simple article and i hope inshallah that it will answer everyone's questions um here we go it's called thoughts on zika and i'm sharing the link with everyone so i talk about paying account retirement accounts paying zakat on women's jewelry because there's a difference of opinion in the sharia in the shaifah method we don't pay zakat on jewelry and then giving zakir money to islamic institutions the the bulk of the article is the retirement accounts and i and i talk about the um uh post retirement age and whatnot so why don't people read that and then if there are questions about that we can you can either reach out to me directly and we can hash it out or we can do in the next session which will be in december wow mashallah it's november already huh yeah so in december we can um i i can dedicate the first question and i can go through the the details usually imams start leading prayers by reciting surat al-fattah directly from alhamdulillah rather than saying bismillah which is part of the surat al-fattah well again there's a difference of opinion about the besmella but the people that recite alhamdulillah start with alhamdulillah because they write they recite the best manner quietly to themselves uh for the shafi's bismillah is the first verse of the fatah and it's the first verse of every surah of the quran except al-baqarah and therefore when i begin reciting the faith i must begin by audibly saying so the difference of opinion can women go to the cemetery burial and or later to the great yeah the prophet saw salam said kum tu an hecomanciar i used to forbid you from going to the graves no go and visit the graves because it will remind you of death so there's nothing there's no prohibition for women or men or old or young going to the graves and it's something that we should do we should because the prophet saws i even have that on a note card here in my my bookshelf that i stare at every day remember often the destroyer of pleasures remember that you're going to die you know that's that will motivate you to do the things that you need to do it will motivate you not to waste your time it will motivate you to take pleasure and enjoy the things that you have it will it will it will sober you up so one of the ways of remembering death is to go visit the great you know we should go once a month as a community uh to go visit you know to the to our cemetery plot in frederick or maybe once a quarter if frederick is too far as a community we should just go and just make dua for those who see i mean can't you make dua for them at the mosque yeah you can but it's also for us to benefit from that this is where we're going to be you know one of us will be here in this next you know plot it has to be very front and center like that so uh going to the grave there's nothing there's nothing wrong with it can we pray fajr lying in bed still i try to get up but sometimes can't bring myself to do it well if you're physically not able to get up of course you can pray sitting lying down praying with your eyes i mean uh the sharia is very flexible when it comes to that so if people have difficulty or whether it's temporary difficulty or whether it's a permanent difficulty like somebody is permanently unable to do that like they have just bad knees or bad hips or whatever or one is just in sick or yeah that's that's permissible if you can't get out requesting do i for sister nidez mom who's dealing with health issues so ask allah for his shepherd in sha allah for all of those who are sick and for his mercy for all of those who have brought past how do you respond when non-muslims talk about adulterers being stoned thieves having their hands cut as part of the shilia is it practiced well i've never really had that you know i've never i think that those those comments are very idiotic so i i don't really i've no one's ever really brought that up with me before because this has to do with uh you know crimes and punishments and uh the the they're very clearly part of our tradition they also have are things that have hardly been practiced throughout islamic history because the burden of establishing these things is so high that it's almost impossible to be carried out and that's the point behind it you know that's why it comes from revelation and that's why allah he's trying to tell us we're not trying he is telling us these are these are grave moral acts uh to to to commit fornication to commit zina to steal somebody else's property these are great you know uh moral crimes and you know take heed and allah establishes in in exchange for that a punishment that at the same time as it the punishment being strong and being intense it's almost impossible to to carry out as i've mentioned so even in that punishment there is a rahma in addition the uh the the way that our legal system seeks to establish these things is that there can be no doubt not beyond reasonable doubt there can be no doubt it's a very it's a different concept the prophet said approach the had the punishments these types of punishments approach them with doubt if there's any type of doubt let's say there there's a act of of zina and there are four witnesses like the quran say four witnesses to the actual act of penetration sorry to be so graphic which is the burden which is almost impossible but let's say that that exists and the four of them they go to the judge and they say yes yes yes yes and then they go to trial and then one of the four recants but now you've introduced doubt even though three other people say yes but one of them changes their mind then there's no punishment that's meted out so people that ask these questions are not people that have read they've not explored they've not understood they've not read the details they've not read the longer books of islamic law so on and so forth so that that's how i would i would think about them they are preventative cautionary it is doing the purview of of the judge and the legal system not to carry them out and many muslim majority countries have not carried out these punishments because of the sharia not despite of the sharia because their understanding of the of the things that i just said it's almost as if like it's not meant really to be carried out literally uh most of the time only in rare circumstances so that's that's how i you know if somebody were to mention that to me that i would try to take them down that path and explain to them the history of our legislation in winter i have difficulty making i have dry skin condition and with the constant wetting and colder temperatures it can exacerbate it is there anything i can do to overcome this difficulty if it's a medical problem that you can't make will do and it's it's causing you harm and the doctor is telling you you know you can't do this then you can make you you can make tayammum uh because you can make taemum if you're sick but i would just you know be careful in taking that opinion or taking that ruling so that you don't you know only you and your doctor will be able to determine if it's harm any other questions do people have just to say how much we appreciate your being up at this time is 3 30 not in the afternoon but in early morning and we really appreciate the dedication and uh may allah bless you for this and hope that favida and the children are also doing well it's my pleasure and i apologize for the logging in i just like everyone else i just go to the email and the most recent iccp email i just it says click here i just click on here so i i didn't know that i was supposed to do something different today i apologize um and um happy happy well i'm not so happy to be up in the middle of the night but i'm happy to do it for iccp and uh when i went to bed last night uh i was so nervous that i was gonna miss that you know like i'm not really sleeping i'm like answering the questions that i have printed out like in my head so i didn't want to miss i didn't want to miss the the session but alhamdulillah i'm happy happy that we have this forum it's very important that we keep this momentum going uh you know soon we'll transition back to regular being in the mosque and all of that so i'm happy that we know we're all of us together are keeping this momentum going is very important for the growth of our community alhamdulillah so thank you all for giving me the opportunity to do this and to serve you thank you any other questions or or or did anything i say if it was not clear this is a good opportunity to ask so we can make it clear i just want to go back to the beginning to see if i missed anything okay no those are all the extra questions okay so we'll we'll put a pin in it there again the zakat thing because it's come up again um i do want whoever are the people that are asking these questions it's a very short article i mean it's not really an article it's just i just answered the question in written form so please do look at that if there are questions about it again uh in the next session i will maybe i'll just go through it all in in all of its detail because it's an import it's an important it's an important point because it keeps coming up so i want people to be very clear about what what they need to do and what they are not obligated to [Music] [Music] foreign you
