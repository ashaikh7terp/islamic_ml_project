Okay. Alhamdulillah. I welcome everyone to our open forum to ask questions. And um the last time we did this was in August. So my apologies it's taken so long. But I still I've been walking around with the the questions since August. Since then, uh there are about 15 16 questions we did not get to. Let me start with those questions. Uh I really don't have many new maybe a couple of new questions. Um and um if people have things that come up, we can deal with them. Uh so picking up where I left off, the questioner says, "I have some questions about most important from one of your classes. I understood that Allah loves I also learned that Allah loves which I'm trying to say all the time. Recently a cousin told me that our beloved prophet told his uncle the best is then there's as I practice all of these forms of I'm not sure which one to pri prioritize as I feel Allah tala will not like it so this is an important question because uh it's actually something that many people express basically what do I do right there's all of these hadith and stories that have different things that we can say and that we can do and The upshot is you should do where whatever you feel inclined to do from the alkar and from the acts of worship. So one of the reasons that we have a plurality of um acts of worship and we have a plurality of devotional things that we can say is because our condition is different. My condition is different from your condition so on and so forth. And my condition can be different today than it is tomorrow. So sometimes you need this, sometimes you need that. That's why we have this variety. So wherever you find your heart, um whatever speaks to you, whatever um helps you, aids you, gives you comfort, that's the that you should you should do. If you're sort of stuck even after I said that then my advice would be to default to the prayers on the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam using any formula um because the prayer on the prophetam especially for the day and age and that we live in can be very uh powerful as a guiding for our overall condition. So don't overthink this issue. My advice is don't overthink it and make the that you are comfortable with. Somebody says I prayed regularly but sometimes pray after in the summer time when it gets too late I'm unsure if Allah accepts my after prayer is any prayer after prayer. So after we've entered into the evening up until the next day. So any of any time you can pray it early, you can pray it late and and don't think that Allah is not going to accept it. Say inshallah Allah is going to accept it. Allah is generous. Is there an version of every dua? Like just praying for whatever Allah knows is best no matter what the dua is. Specific dua lets me be more desperate, sincere with Allah, but I want to work towards what is better. Do I do both? For example, asking for my loved ones to die in a peaceful manner at old age versus ya Allah whatever is best for them in this life or ya Allah let me meet my future spouse as soon as possible versus ya Allah whatever is best for me you know best again don't like the the first question we began with when it comes to um you know the variety issue you call on Allah with what is in your heart you based on your needs needs. Of course, much of our dua is general. Uh, you know, Allah forgive me, guide me, you know, help me. It's it's it's general. And then sometimes we're we're in a fix and we need something specific. So my advice is not to overthink it but to try to create a scenario where you have a pure connection with Allah subhana ta and you call on Allah night and day and night with with that which concerns you with that which is in your heart of course from a you know kind of like a spiritual hierarchy optimally you know the way of the saints is you know Allah as long as you're not upset with me then I'm not going to be concerned you know is to have that higher perspective and to be where Allah tala has placed you but sometimes it's a spiritual disposition so sometimes you're not we're not always at that level or sometimes we're in a specific bind so calling for the specific is permissible of course because the prophet himself called for the specifics calling for the general is usually what we do because also the prophet called for the general so Don't overthink these things. Work towards having a smooth relationship with Allah subhana wa tala. Okay. Next question. Say I have a lawful intention. Sorry. Say I have a lawful good intention for the sake of Allah and a neutral good intention like it's fun but the neutral good intention is stronger. How do I get the former to be stronger? Here's an example. I'm a writer and want to impact readers beneficially through my writing, but I also write because it's fun and I don't know if that desire is stronger. I'm sensing a lot of binary um with all of the questions. So, this is also maybe a larger theme is not to be binary. Um now again from the spiritual hierarchy the higher and and better and loftier disposition is that everything that we do we do solely for the sake of Allah subhana wa ta'ala meaning that we see no other angle of the acts that we do except for Allah subhah so let's take something neutral like eating or drinking the ultimate spiritual disposition towards those acts is I'm going to eat and drink uh only to give myself energy uh to be able to worship Allah subhana wa ta'ala purely not that oh this is like a cool drink of water or this is a nice sip of tea or so on and so but at the same time we're human and we uh Allah has given us the capacity to taste these different things to like certain foods to not like certain The prophet stayed away from was not used to. So there's a point of view in that. But the higher spiritual disposition is not to pay attention to those things and to do things only for the sake of Allahh. But it's not black and white. Just like the hadith when the prophet sallallaihi wasallam said you get from your prayer that which you that which you are able to concentrate in and focus on that portion that you are in the zone you are going to get the reward of that prayer. So it's the same thing you know you all of these things will be rewarded or another way of saying it is that there's nothing wrong with having the h human component or as the questioner says the fun component as an intention that isn't reduced from uh the act being accepted or the intention being accepted but it is slightly lesser than the act being done solely for the sake of Allah. time. Okay, next question. I understand the need for hell especially these days, but I struggle with understanding an eternal hell, especially when our actions in the world are finite. However evil a person is, if if infinity is infinity, couldn't they be cleansed of even the worst sin at some point? As a matter of fact, this is one of the opinions amongst all As a matter of fact, this was the opinion that was held by Omaru that that hellfire is finite, not infinite. It's a weaker position. Of course, the the more dominant position is, you know, you know, everlasting in it forever uh is everlasting forever. But there is an opinion that says that hell itself is finite and it will convert from um as the questioner even said you know after sort of a a a period of cleansing it will it will it will be like a prison sentence where people are just used to it but not punished anymore etc. So that exists that position exists for exactly the same reason as the questioner. So one shouldn't feel odd about that and if it makes one comfortable to adopt that position you can okay next question how do I come to understand in the death of a loved one better spiritually that in that moment death was better for them than life despite all my prayers I also worry about thinking that it's because they couldn't become a worse Allah says every person will taste death. Um our life is not our own but given to us on loan by our creator jaw. So how do you understand it is to remind yourself that life is given to us as a gift by Allah subhana wa tala and you know from Allah we come into him we will return uh and therefore when we are called back we are called back as a matter of fact in Arabic uh in in um sort of uh usage and like modern usage there's a there's a thing in the Arabic language where people don't like to say negative things outright. So they always phrase negative things in an al alternate way. One of the way people call death is they say Allah remembered him. Allah remembered so and so meaning that they died meaning so they were called back to Allah subhana wa tala. I of course Allah doesn't forget about us but it's just a kind of an expression to avoid saying he died and and being that you know kind of in your face. So remember that that you know our time will come all of us and uh we then also at the same time equally believe in Allah ta's infinite love and mercy and forgiveness and for the believers that pass away we are like okay this is better for them because they are now in Allah tala's forgiveness and his in his mercy and his rahma so on and so forth so it's better exactly how we we act when there's a calamity when there's like a natural calamity a tornado or hurricane hurricane, earthquake, a tsunami and innocent people die as as rarely they do on the exterior it's very sad because innocent people die but also we know on the on the interior on the on the inner meaning those people are saved you know in everlasting bliss. So this exterior act of tragedy has led to an infinite act of mercy and forgiveness. So to remember those two halves together would be my advice. Next question. When I complain about oppressive systems at work in society, white supremacy, uh in my mind there are specific people or instances I'm talking about even if I'm talking generally. How does this relate to backbiting? And also how do I cautious about complaining when talking about issues where the world/ people are just messed up? I know the people of gratit the path of gratitude is better but it becomes murky when angry about injustice. First of all uh the idea of backbiting is not in this case when there is a public harm or evil that affects everybody or a huge group of people etc. Uh so if there's an oppressive situation saying that this is an oppressive situation is not backbiting because you what you are saying is basically you are saying you are uh narrating or documenting or standing witness to something that's already happening standing witness to the truth. So if somebody right now would say on this evening we had an online session of an open Q&A session with where Tar answered questions, you're just sort of there's no there's no backbiting in that because you're just stating something that happened. If you said um we had this online situation session and uh Tar sucked and he was off the mark and we didn't like what happened and you said all these negative things about me. um that could enter into backbiting because now you're giving your sort of personal situation. So first of all when you talk about something that's public you're talking about something that's public there's you're just narrating something that's already happened. At the same time in addition to that if there's something that's negative and uh oppressive we have it's a natural disposition to reject that which is oppressive because Allah tells us in the Oh the children of Adam, I have made injustice against my nature impossible. It is haram and I have also made it haram between you. So do not be unjust one to another. So when we see this unjustice, we want to remove it because it's a form of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil. So there's no backbiting involved in that. Um yes, we are we are grateful. Ours is a path of gratitude. If you are grateful, Allah gives you increase. But also part of the human condition for us is to try to remove that injustice. whether the we remove that injustice slowly, softly, quietly, aggressively, publicly. I mean there are different things you know if you saw um an older person uh abusing an animal you know we would jump in and you know by force we would try to remove that injustice. But if you see systematic racism uh that's you know hundreds of years old okay it's going to it's going to take a long time to undo that. But our job as witnesses of the truth is to slowly do our best to remove that injustice. That's what is forbidding enjoying the good and forbidding the evil. And enjoining the good and the forbidding the evil has are of different levels. And all of those acts of enjoying the good and forbidding the evil have conditions the conditions. So sometimes you are going to do it by your mouth, by by by speech by sometimes you're going to do it by actions, by your hands. Sometimes you're only going to be able to do it by your heart as the hadith states. So nothing wrong with speaking as as a matter of fact, it's our obligation to speak out against injustice, especially if we have an ability to help protect those that are being um persecuted. Next question. I have ADHD. My Hoshua is worlds different when I keep a small piece of paper nearby with some of the things I'd like to pray about written on it to look at while praying and remembering. Is this okay? 100% this is fine. Um because uh well I mean it it works for the person and there's nothing in that act that invalidates the prayer. What invalidates the prayer or one of the things that invalidates the prayer is if you speak out loud on purpose. So, you know, if I'm praying and then, you know, somebody walks in and I start talking to them, okay, I've left the prayer. But if I glance at a piece of paper to remind me, uh, that there's nothing wrong. Just like sometimes we have the Quran in front of us or we're holding the Quran and we're reading from it, that doesn't invalidate the prayer. Um, well, it doesn't invalidate the prayer because we're actually reading from the Quran. So, that's a different I mean, we're that the Quranic recitation is the heart of the prayer. So maybe that's not the best example, but anyway, it's fine if you had a p a piece of paper next to you, like new Muslims or people that have not been praying and are praying or are just learning how to pray. Sometimes you write those things for the person. I remember when we were in college, we had a young man uh who came from anomaly from like a Muslim background but never really prayed at all. So I remember we were helping him pray. So I kind of like wrote for him like on a sheet of paper um you know these are the the things that you say especially the the fat and the because he didn't know the fat. So he would look down and and it was it was in English letters but um transliteration and that's how he learned to pray. So there's nothing wrong with that. Next question. How does one calculate prayers for a 14 plus hour long flight especially from east to west when every time zone you pass it could just be f okay we've mentioned this before that there's a difference of opinion about praying in the plane so there are legitimate opinions that that say you must pray in the plane uh and in the med we have a position that says you cannot pray in the plane because being connected to the earth is a condition for the prayer's uh validity. So in my mab I don't pray in the plane because because that I'm suspended in the air. That's what flying is. And therefore when I land I pray the prayers that I missed while I was in flight like in this case if it was a long flight. Sometimes it might be a whole five prayer cycle depending on when the train takes off and lands. And there's no sin involved, you know, in following that position. So, putting that opinion to the side, assuming that you want to pray on the plane, and in this in this uh instant, I can't say do this opinion or not that opinion because they're both valid. I'm just saying this is what I do in my method. If you are going to pray on the plane, you can only pray when the time of the prayer has come in. So, that's one of the challenges. And you have to face the and you have to stand uh you can't just sit in your seat and pray is as long as you're physically able to stand and pray you have to stand and pray. Some allow in that case that you can sit but at least we would say you'd have to face the so that's another challenge. Um and you would have to be able to look outside and uh is it time for this prayer? Is it time for that prayer? Of course, because you're in a state of travel, you can combine and then shorten the prayers like But let's say I left off in the afternoon. I can't pray until I see that the sun has set outside. So, if you're flying in a situation where you're away from the sun and the sun's always up, then haven't come in yet, even if the hours have have extended. So it's a little bit more tricky where you have to correspond to what is naturally uh uh around you. Likewise, if you're fasting, by the way, okay, if you're fasting and you're on a plane, you can only break your fast when you see that the sun has gone down, even if you're adding hours to the fasting day. And vice versa, you can only start your fast um once you see that this the f has come in. So, if you are on like a non-Muslim flight, like a non-Muslim captain flying the plane, it might be hard to determine those things. Sometimes on quote unquote Muslim carriers, if it's like part of a a carrier of a Muslim majority country, sometimes they will help announce those type of things. Uh, but not always. So, that one's a little tricky. I know for prayer there are opinions that you can make woodoo out Sorry. Make dua out loud under your breath in your own language. My prayer is so much better when I do this as opposed to saying prayers just in my mind. Are these allowances for prayer? When you are in sujud, this is the time to make dua and you can make dua uh in whatever language um inshallah. Okay, next question. I'm trying uh to regularly wake up 30 minutes before and pray. However, summer hours are hard, 3 hours of sleep, 1 hour of being awake, etc. And then 3 hours of sleep make me a bit lethargic during the day. Any advice? What was the prophetic model for sleep? Um well, one solution is you could pray. with. So let's say is at 7 8 o'clock pm. I'm just making it up. And then obviously if is at 8 then a is going to be at least 9:30 or or later. Um so I can combine with and then sleep. So I can get sleep earlier and then therefore therefore I could probably gain another hour and a half or almost two hours of sleep by doing that and waking up before fed to do the that would be one option. Um the upshot of this question is that there is just less nighttime hours. That's the idea of summer that the day is just longer and the night is shorter. What was the prophetic model of sleep? You know very different than the way we sleep. um in which first of all there you know there was a post fed nap that the prophet used to take which would aid in this situation but basically the prophet would sleep and many of the Sahabah almost after ish you know like shortly after they would sleep for us we don't really do that because of the artificial lights that we have we just kind of keep going and that's I think the the the the Achilles heel of people that want to follow the prophetic model of sleep which I'm not I wouldn't advocate because we are in a very different mo way we are in a different very different way of life and different ages and bodily needs we should be sleeping according to what our body needs but if we were to analyze the sleep of the prophetam it was stop and go stop and go stop and go he would sleep after a shet wake up for a little bit you know maybe sleep a little bit before fed or wake up before you know that that could be very exhausting if you're not used to it. Um, so those are sort of my comments on that on that question. Uh, it's obviously a lot easier in the winter because then you have more hours in the night time. Okay, next question. When I'm on my period, can I sit in the back when others are prayer and follow the suras and make dua with them? Would it be bad if I did my own sujud as well as I miss the closeness of sjud while internally understanding I am separate from the jamaat? No. If a woman has her period, she cannot remain in the mosque. Um so uh in in our case what we would say is you cannot be in the prayer hall but you could be elsewhere on the campus or elsewhere uh in a place that is not considered or the prayer hall because we have really a campus uh with multiple or now you know we were saying a village with multiple things that are you know multiple buildings. uh we're not just a quote unquote traditional mosque where there's just one building and that's it. But the the fick of it is that if a woman has her cycle, she cannot remain in the mosque. So we would just slightly rephrase that in in the ICCP situation to say if a woman had her period, she couldn't remain in the malah and the areas where we pray but could be elsewhere on the campus because then that would not technically be considered the mosque from a point of view. Secondly, you can't do sujud or raor any of that because that's you have something that's preventing you from doing that which is the cycle. Just like if I was in a state of jeneba uh for whatever reason man or woman I would not be able to pick up the Quran, read the Quran or make sujud. So this is a situation in which we in which you must remember to comply with the Quran and Sunnah and that's where the reward is not to do like oh I feel good to do this or I feel good to that but rather I'm going to obey as best as I can and submit my own desires to that of the Okay, next question. How long is it advised to wait to pray J? I'm assuming the question means we have the adan and then we're going to wait to make the to pray. Part of this is custom part of it is function where we give the aden people hear the aden and therefore we need to give people a moment or a period of time to do stop what they're doing make wudoo make their way to the mosque and pray. Of course, the aen for us does not serve that function because most likely nobody hears the ad then except the people that are in the mosque. Maybe if you're on the campus, if you're on certain places on the campus, you might not even hear the as well because maybe the speakers are not loud enough. So therefore, there is a waiting period between the adan and the that is sort of like a custom customarily, which is something that we would come to an agreement upon that makes sense. um you know it could be 10 minutes 12 minutes you know I don't think it would be more than 15 minutes after the the the beginning of the prayer unless we found that it made sense in a particular prayer at a particular time of the year in which we're going to make the ad then but then we're going to wait like an hour because no one's going to come at that I mean that could be but it's really up to us to come up to that determination um and that's published as we have it on our screens or you or in a timetable so people know what to expect. Okay, next question. Do I say subhah when I make sujud after I make a mistake in prayer? Yes. If you're going to do the two prostrations of forgetfulness, you're going to do the it's you say the same thing. Next question. I have three more on the list and then I'll turn to the newer questions. Uh, I like listening to Islamic podcasts while getting ready for bed, but the name of Allah is mentioned and I often go back and forth from the bathroom just using the room. Should I avoid doing this? No, that's fine. Uh, there's nothing that prohibits that inshallah. In prayer, can I recite in Arabic but glance briefly at an English translation of the Quran so that I can get more familiar with what I'm reciting? This is related to the questioner that we had a couple questions earlier about having a piece of prayer like with a piece of paper with prompts and whatnot while one is praying. You could do that but you can't you can't read out loud obviously the English because that would invalidate the prayer. So that would be fine but with a with that caveat. Okay. And then the last pray last question that's on my list this is question 58 by by the way from back in August. Uh, I like listening. Oh, this is the same question repeated the podcast question. I answered that. So, that's there was 57 questions. Okay. Alhamdulillah, I don't have to walk around with this. I mean, literally, I've been having this paper with me for the last several months. Um there was one question that that came on the email which is um a little bit okay. Why do we say make prayer or make dua? Is there there any significance to the word make rather than just say say prayer or say dua? Um, no. It's just because we're English and Arabic are kind of are crossing. Uh, there's no, this has no linguistic bearing on on the meaning. There's no bearing on the meaning of e either of that of those usages. Did you say your prayers? Did you make your prayers? In Arabic, you would say, you know, did you pray? Uh, that's another way of saying it. So there's nothing wrong uh or there's no impact on that. And I see in the chat there are three questions. Let me see. How do we improve our salah and faith? You improve your salah by making sure that you have a good and full wudoo before the prayer. So the key to the prayer as the say is the woodoo. And that's something that a lot of us just you know ignore because we just feel like I'm just splashing water on my body. What's the big deal? Wudoo is an act of worship. We forget it's an it's not it's not simply you know just splashing water on random parts of your body. So if you are concentrating in your woodoo, if you are doing a full woodoo, if you're getting everything um uh wet the the way all the body parts are wet the way it's supposed to be in the woodoo, then you have a higher chance that you are going to be bring that type of focus to the salah. Uh also when it comes to salah, you know, there is a need to learn basic of the wudoo and the prayer so that one is praying correctly. Um and there are mistakes in prayer uh that people can conduct or people do uh whether it's not covering what needs to be covered properly or not moving in the proper way so on and so forth. So learning those things um can can and will have a qualitative uh impact on the prayer inshallah. When it comes to faith, the way we increase our faith is to increase our remembrance of Allah subhana wa tala. So the big things, the big belief points, belief in God, belief in the hereafter, so you know, reconciling that we are going to die, those type of things, the way we keep that stuff front and center is to remember them frequently. The prophet sallallaihi wasallam said remember frequently the destroyer of pleasure which is what the the word that the prophet used for death. So you can't really remember something unless you remember frequently enough. So that's what is to constantly remember. That's how we increase our faith inshallah. Non-Muslim visitor. Next question. Non-Muslim visitors wish to see the Quran and flip the pages. We often allow them to do so. Anything wrong have I to have woodoo every time I hold the Quran to read it. When it comes to non-Muslims read touching the mus they should not. So we can in that case we should have a Quran in which there's a translation uh you know one side could be the Arabic one side could be the English or could be line by line for that purpose for those purposes only those who are in a state of purity meaning that they have washed from jeneva I mean both spiritual purity and in this case actual purity from the point of view so no non-Muslims should not touch the mus um and that's something if we're doing that we should not do that That's something that we should stop and we should just have them look at the um translation. Or another option is if we had the musaf that was in the you know the pas like the 30 little booklets each one by itself is not technically the musf. Um the musf as we said is the definition of the Quran. The technical definition in Islamic law is all of the suras of the Quran beginning from the fat to the n in one volume written in the authentic script. So if you took a juz or like you know one away by itself that's not the technical definition of the Quran. So that would be another option. Do you have to have woodoo every time you hold the Quran? The majority opinion says yes. Uh there is a a notable dissenting opinion uh with Iban Hazam or in the Zaheri school which is one of the the one of the medabs of Islamic law and in our condition that would probably be the more appropriate position and opinion because there should be nothing that prevents you from having a relationship with the Quran. So this is a little bit of a kind of um ethical aspect with the legal aspect is that if you follow the majority opinion on this topic it could not necessarily but it could lead to a situation where every time you want to touch the Quran like well I don't have so I'm not going to touch it. So you end up not reading the Quran or anything like that. That's a bad outcome. So in that case it would make more sense to follow the other opinion. For what it's worth, I personally follow that opinion for exactly that reason. Um, and especially if you're reviewing your Quran or you have a daily w of the Quran that you're committed to, you read one or several Jews a day, usually those type of people tend to follow that opinion that it's okay to have the musf when you don't have woodoo in order to uh not have a barrier between them and the Quran. So the goal for us is to have a relationship with the Quran. I see a lot of questions coming in. Next time it would be helpful if you if people sent them in, I will entertain as much as I can tolerate. Um, inshallah. Can we read the Quran without woodoo? Yes, you don't have to have woodoo to read the Quran. That's not a condition for reading the Quran. Okay, this next set of questions, for some reason, the font is small. I have to get a little closer. I have some questions regarding the etiquette of salah. If someone enters the masjid late after the prayer or the have already started, is it better to do the and masjid or what? This is a known difference of opinion uh between the shaf and the makis and um and ironically they're both based on the same hadith. Uh so this is one of those instances in Islamic law where two um opinions which are opposite to one another are based on the same proof text and it's one of the teaching points that we use when we teach it's it's known as the of that's the name of the hadith it's in Bkari in Muslim that when a companion came into the masjid late on Friday he sat down the prophet interrupted himself in the said you know why don't you stand and greet the mosque and he did and then sat down the shaf we take from that hadith and we interpret it primmaacia well look obviously when you come late to the mosque and the is speaking you're supposed to pray two raka's sunnah the malikes will say based on the same hadith we conclude the opposite and we read the hadith as being specific only to not a general statement so some injunctions and the primary sources are general and some of them are specific Uh so there's a difference of opinion. So whatever you feel comfortable doing in this case you can do like when I walk in late and that's I pray because that's my meth that's the opinion that I follow. Um if you walk in and they're praying well obviously you need to the then you need to join the prayer. If one is doing one of the the prayers and someone usually a child makes a loud noise or even hurts themselves what is the proper thing to do? Well, if somebody hurts themselves, you got to leave the prayer and go save that person. If it requires leaving the prayer, if the child is in front of you, then you could like bend down and pick them up. And that type of movement wouldn't invalidate the prayer. But you know the famous example that they give in books of Islamic laws, if you see a blind man or I guess by extension woman who's walking who who might fall into a well, you have to leave the prayer and go save that. But you don't say, "Oh, it's okay. I guess I'm in prayer. I'm in prayer. I'm in prayer. It's okay. What happens to them?" No, we have to leave the prayer and save them. The prophetam didn't do a sunnah after but you forget and do it. Is that wrong? No. If you forget, it's wrong. It's okay. Allah forgives that which is we do out of forgetfulness. Why do we practice, read and memorize the Quran if we don't know the meaning? Shouldn't we read our own language to understand the Quran? The Quran, the definition of the Quran, I just mentioned a while ago, all of the suras from in one volume written in the authentic script, meaning that it's written in Arabic. So Allah says, we have revealed to you the the Quran in Arabic in order that you may understand. Not meaning that it's revealed in Arabic because it was it came to the Arabs so that they can understand. No, that these great meanings of the final message can only be carried in this sacred language. So therefore there is something sacred about the Arabic of uh of the Quran and the Arabic Quran when it is recited even if the meaning is not known has a shif has a healing. So like there are verses that we read upon, you know, people that are sick and we read them in Arabic that has a healing power. Like when you take a medicine, do you know what all of the chemical components are the medicine or? No. But you take it and then it works. It's the same thing. So that's the answer why we read the Quran in the Arabic even if we don't know. But that doesn't mean we stop at that. We should seek to know. Seeking to know the meanings. You can do that in another language. So you can read the tap in Arabic or you can read the tapsi in English or Udu or Swuahili or Persian or Ottoman Turkish. So French, German that's fine. It gives you the meaning. And there are many centers of Islamic learning in which you know the maybe the main instruction was not in the Arabic language. Uh but the primary sources are in the Arabic language. You can't really understand the Quran and the Sunnah unless it's understood from the Arabic language. So that's why because it's the the actual words themselves are ver are this is the word of Allah subhana tala and therefore there's a healing to it. If there are many years of mis prayer that's too difficult for someone to make up that is somebody already has trouble doing the salah on time or keeping up with them as it is. How should they prior to prioritize what's needed uh or go about making up the prayers in a way that's not overwhelming? All prayers that have been missed must be made up no matter how long how many prayers there are. So in this situation I have many years of madeup prayers. So I'm going to do a couple of things. Number one, I'm not going to pray any more sunnah prayers. And number two, every time I pray a prayer and I finish salam, I'm going to stand and make up that make pray a makeup prayer of that prayer. And that will take place instead of the sunnah prayers. And making up a prayer, there is more reward in that than making up than praying a sunnah prayer. So one shouldn't feel like oh I'm not able to pray the sunnah. You're getting more reward because you're doing something that you were supposed to do. So I finished. I'm going to pray. I finished. I'm going to make up so on and so forth until slowly inshallah one finishes their prayer. And just you know take it one prayer at a time, one day at a time. If someone is dying and the doctors have given up hope and left it to the family and there is a feeling that it's better to pull the plug to make it easier on the person. The family is torn relating to this issue. What is the right thing to do? If somebody's life is directly connected to the machine and unplugging the machine will lead to certain death, we cannot unplug the machine because then the unplugging the machine would lead to that person's death. So the decision point needs to be made before that um whether the person should be on the machine or not. The only exception to that is if there is brain if the person is considered dead or brain dead there's no activity clinically. Most modern fatwa positions allow the brain death to be considered equal to Sharia death because medically and shar if you can use that word there are different definitions of death. Um so if the doctors agree that this is it, the person is dead and there's nothing there are Sharia opinions that can allow for that to take place. That would be the only exception. Um and then you know somebody should be consulted in that situation. Sharia person should be consulted as well as the physicians in that situation. Can women in periods stay in the library at ICCP? Um, in in building a we've we've said in the past, yes, because it's not part of the mus because the masala is sort of through those two archways up the stairs. So, it's like a different part. Um, can we make sujud in our own language only in prayers? Yeah, I mean you can. We said we can make dua in your own language in sujud. Oh, people are saying that maybe some of the questions they sent ended up in the junk. I don't get the questions. So, if if they ended up in the junk, I apologize on behalf of of us. Um, but here I'm I'm answering them now. There's like maybe four or five more. If I do woodoo and wear socks, can I wipe on the socks when I do woodoo for the next prayer? If yes, no. Could you elaborate on this? Um the traditional position is that the socks uh which we call in in the language of the Sharia that you wipe over must be water resistant and you must be able to walk in them. Water resistant meaning that you know if I was wearing like a cover and I dripped water I wouldn't feel it and I must be able to walk around you know around with them. uh they don't have to be leather. Uh they can be like Gortex or you know any like any type of material but that will be the traditional so that that traditional opinion excludes pretty much all of the socks that we wear. Uh there is a position in the bal that allows for the socks that we wear because they interpret the hadith of the sock covering to be anything that covers the foot whether it's thick or thin. Um, so in in in our circumstance, you can follow that position. So when I'm out and about, um, especially in non-Muslim areas, I follow that position because it's sometimes it's impossible to take off your sock and there's no place to wipe your foot or or to dry it. So I will take that position. It's a valid position that one can follow especially in our circumstance. But the sock has to cover all of the foot uh meaning the toes, the feet up and to past the ankles. I recently received a pay raise and managed to save some money. Congratulations. Now I have some saved money on the side and I think I should be paying zaka for this money. I never paid zaka before. So could you explain how zaka is calculated? Paid zaka for money. The first thing is we need to see um what the isab is the minimal zakatable amount. So if I've saved 500 bucks, I'm not I don't have to pay zakat 500 bucks because that's too little. What is the what is the minimal zakatable amount for money? It is the the dollar amount of 85 grams of 21 karat gold. So you can go online and you can see what is the price of gold. Let's do that together right now. Price of gold in grams. Total spot price for a gram of gold today is $106.54. So 106.54 * 85 g. So the nisab today as we're recording this is $9,000. $9,55.90. So if you have $9,000 $9,55.90 and more, that's the first you've you've fulfilled the first condition for zaka to be paid. If you have less than that, then you don't have to worry about zak. The second condition is one whole lunar year. One whole un lunar year must have passed when you have that amount or more in your possession. So, let's say I got $10,000 bonus today and then three months later I spent half of it on something. Then I've gone below the nisab and I have not held that amount for a whole year. That's the second condition. And then the third condition is that you have outright ownership of an outright and unencumbered ownership of that money. Meaning you can do with it what you want. If you fulfill those three conditions after that year, after the lunar year, then you will pay 2.5% of that in zakat. This relates to what you said about holding the Quran. How can we promote the Quran and its beauty script to non-Muslims if they cannot fit or hold the Quran? Well, as I said, you there are there are ways around what I said. I mean, but I can't change the ruling because because I don't have the authority to do we don't have the authority to do that. So you can show them a page of the Quran, a juz of the Quran. You can show them the Quran. There are translations of the Quran which one side is Arabic and one side is English. So that's that's how we would do it. Um uh there's a great book called um I'm looking because it's called the splenders of the Quran, calligraphy and illumination. Um uh which is and Martin Lings actually wrote the introduction to that. That's a beautiful book uh that has huge fullcolored uh faximiles of pages of some of the most beautiful Quran. So I mean having something like that in our mosque, a book that shows the beauty of the Quranic manuscripts would be another solution. I mean if you wanted to show the beauty of of it, that's how we could do it. Can you give some tips on finding a suitable spouse? Make dua and you know be in the right place. I mean think where would a suitable person be? Um and those are the places where you should be and then ask yourself am I a suitable person? Uh because if you're looking for a spouse that other person is also looking for a spouse too. So to find the right person you need to be the right person as well. So um and we have our own in ICCP our own kind of mechanisms for trying to get people young people together or single I don't I don't want to assume only young people need to be married single people together uh and I would suggest to be part of the larger community and all of the things that we do all of the social functions that we have is important uh that's where we would increase the likelihood of finding the right person inshallah three three More questions. Uh, if a woman bleeds abnormally for four consecutive days, then later realizes it was unusual and not her period, uh, would she have to make up those salah? Well, the minimal menstrual cycle in the Sharia is 24 hours. Um, so at bare minimal, if a woman starts bleeding, she would have to wait for a minimum of 24 hours to determine whether that was her menstrual cycle or not. The maximum time for the menstrual cycle is 15 days. So let's say a woman has a cycle for 3 or 4 days, then stops for 2 days and then starts bleeding again. Well, since we are still within the 15 days, that's all one cycle. If we've gone past 15 days, 15 days and just one minute. And then that blood is not considered the blood of the menstrual cycle. It's called not but it's called irregular bleeding. And in that case, the woman makes theul and resumes her prayer. So for the questioner when you say four consecutive days and unusual it depends where they happen visav what is considered the normal cycle to be able to answer the question in the summer is late some people combine and is this permissible yes this is permissible this imuti also had this position independently of the mab especially for the summer months because it can be very difficult um especially a lot of us as we grow older we sleep early. Um, so that's completely a valid position inshallah. And the last question before me is when sisters make woodoo, can they wipe over their headscarves or do they have to remove the headscarves to do it? There's a difference of opinion amongst the the schools of law of how much of the head needs to be covered. In the shafi mab, we only have to to wipe sorry, how much of the hair needs to be wiped over for the wudoo to be valid. In the shi m the minimum is three hairs. So if I had my hand was wet if I went like this that would be enough. I would be considered to have woodoo. Um and then I could wipe over the rest because the prophet wiped over his turban or the hadith for that. For the other you have to do the whole head or a larger part of the head. So um if a woman is out and about and she's covered normally and it's difficult to do that, she can follow that opinion. Uh and inshallah that will fulfill the wud requirement for her. That's a a neat kind of a neat hack for her. All right. So maybe we were close to 30 questions tonight. Alhamdulillah. Those are all of the questions uh before me. Unless I miss something. I apologize if I miss something, but we will have another session like this uh at the end of May uh where we'll be able to have any questions. Um I'm assuming I I'll just like wait like one or two minutes to see if there's anything else. Um nice to see all of you join. A lot of new names. [Music] Um is with us? Uh oh, there's something else. Let's see. Is there particular dua for starting growth on a farm or garden? Like during the spring planting time? Anything we can say when planting seeds or seeds in the ground? Actually, there is. And unfortunately, I don't have it memorized. I'd have to look at Immawi's book of Why don't I make a note of that? We can pick up with that on the next one. There's dua for planting. There's dua for the first sign of growth. Um, all of sort of the natural cycles you will find dua for, you know, dua for spring, fall, winter. There are duats like that. Dua for seeing the new moon, the crescent moon. Dua for uh rain, of course, we know thunder and lightning. Um dua when the rain falls dua when the rain is too much, you know, around us, not on top of us. So, interestingly, we could create our own little thin volume of all of the nature focused dua. The all of the cycles of nature will have some kind of dua associated with with it. And that also reminds us I mean this is kind of a good a good thing um for us to to think about and reflect about is that Islam is a very green a green religion and if we look at the different aspects of our faith and the practice of our faith it's very much connected to the environment around us. So for example we every month has to every month is determined by citing the new moon. So there's actually an effort to go out and see the new moon and that necessitates finding an area where there's no artificial light, where the light is clear and you're looking in the right place for the moon. So there's always a kind of an interaction with with that. Um and sort of just something interesting. Somebody's asking how is the Jordan and the program in the college or oh the the the university. It's fine. I mean I teach online so I'm recording. Um I'm in the the process of recording all of the courses. I teach the Shafi uh BA and there's another team in the England that teaches the Hanafi BA. Uh I actually I teach all of the Shafi classes. So I have like four years of course work I have to record. I'm I'm now in year three. Alhamdulillah. And that's going well. The students are increasing that are joining the university. Um you know it has its challenges. I think online learning has its challenges. It's not always the smoothest. Things get lost in translation. I think something is clear, but then there are questions. So, it's a learning process, but my focus has largely been on getting the recorded content out there. That's really the big has been the biggest burden for me for the last two years because I travel. So, when I travel, I can't record, you know, I have to sit and I have to have the camera and the microphones and every I have to have the books in front of me. So, because I travel, it's always like stop and go, stop and go. So um like in right now as we speak I'm teaching uh and my book's next I'm teaching um inheritance law which is a lot of math and fractions and um you know there's like these inheritance charts you know and um this is I got to be honest this is not the funnest subject to teach um but unfortunately I'm traveling on Sunday so I'm going to have to stop recording and then pick it up. So, alhamdulillah, it's going well. Uh, no complaints from me. It's a blessing to teach um Islamic the Islamic sciences of course. So, and personally I I benefit the most I feel because I get to review. So, for me to review all of the different uh sciences. So I don't just teach I teach I teach hadith Quran logic um you know modern issues Islamic governance so all of those subjects I teach I teach so for me it's great because I get to review but you know I have to be honest not all the subjects really excite me I mean inheritance law does not excite me the way other subjects do but alhamdulillah What is the most interesting thing in Islamic law that most people don't know about? Well, most people don't know is the way that we interpret and understand the Quran and Sunnah. That's the key and that's really a work of art. Um so to to study is to be able to to know how to balance like the hadith that we just mentioned about the hadith of that one text can give you two opposite meanings. One meaning is taken prema from the hadith. The prophet told to pray the two raqas to greet the mosque. Therefore my methodology of interpretation is that's a as a principle. Imam Malik he said no because the people of Medina where I grew up Immalik is saying this they were the children of the Sahaba they didn't do that so why did the children of the Sahaba not do that let me investigate and then he finds out that Sulle was a poor companion who lived in the outskirts of Medina he would only come to town on Fridays hopefully that hoping that the richer Sahaba would support him and give him you know some donations so that particular Friday he came late so the prophet Phetam out of mercy for him wanted him to stand so people would know that he was in the mosque. So he gave him a specific directive. So you see it's a different interpretive methodology all based on the same text. This is what we call um and that's I think the most important thing that people don't know about. Okay, there's one more question that came. This has got to be the last question we're going to end. Uh because I have I have like 15 minutes or 20 minutes until fed. There is a a site Sharia Whiz that's also helps folk set up an Islamic will trust in the US Sharia inheritance law affordable too. Yeah. And I I believe Imam Rafi was involved uh as a consultant on that project. Sharia um yes I've heard of that. I'm not famili I have not used them but I I'm familiar with that. Please just say okay. Okay. Okay. This is the last question because it came from Sister Samuda. So if I say no, she's going to No, somebody sent it to me just now. Well, if I don't say if I don't say yes to Sister Zamuda, she's going to hunt me down. Okay. I'm trying to fill up the form for a renewal passport and found out that the picture head covering is not acceptable unless I submit a statement verifying that it is part of recognized traditional religious attire that is customarily or required to be worn continuously in public. I don't know if that's true because I mean I I know many women who's my wife included whose wear hijab and their passport picture is normal. It is recent. She just now got is renew immigration. I remember when we immigration paperwork the the image had to reveal I think an ear or something like that. In any case, when it comes to security issues like IDs, this is an issue in which the Sharia is more flexible because there are security concerns involved. So for example, if a woman wears, she has to remove her if she's taking a obviously IG photo or if a woman wears and comes to a mui, the mui has to require her to remove her face covering as he has to look in it. So this is a a legal thing. Of course, there's no sin in complying, but I think that if you should look into how you should sub submit a letter or something. Uh I mean, I think there are many Muslims who have US passports. It's not a problem. Women that is. So, this is this is not should not be something that is foreign to the uh to the state department. I would look into that. Okay. We've come to the end for today. Alhamdulillah. We will continue our Friday classes on Friday. Uh so we leave uh we put a pin in it here. [Music] [Music] [Music] See you guys all Friday night. Take care. Or you can sit and lower it.
