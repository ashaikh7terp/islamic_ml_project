foreign so we have some questions not many questions but they're big questions so we'll try to take our time to do them Justice insha Allah in no particular order and completely Anonymous the first question is can you please explain the proper way of how a widow must observe the period of mourning after losing one spouse specifically can she travel overseas to be with family while she faces her loss Etc or she bound to the home she shared with her spouse so the Quran tells us that the waiting period for the woman after she loses her husband after her husband passes is four months and ten days and the Ed the period is something that is legislated by Allah thank you is legislated by Allah upon women and in it is a tremendous reward because the I had the period would even supersede something like Hajj so for example if a woman was going to go to Hajj or she was planning or she paid money and and the death happens around the Hajj months even the the that enormity of that Great ACT would be superseded by the idea so no the woman needs to remain in the marital house meaning that she needs to spend the night in that marital house it doesn't mean that she's not allowed to leave the house but the period means that where the family was where the life of the husband and wife took place that you will remain in that house meaning that she will spend the night in that house she can leave the house during the day as she as is required if she's working or to buy food or medicine and things like that what if the lady who whose husband passes is is ill or is unable to do that then after the death occurs she can move right away to a relative's house a child's house and then perform the Eda period there but traveling to be with family as this should be the other way around people should come to her and the focal hat remind us that in the as I said is this tremendous reward for the lady so we should not think of it as something that is limiting but rather we should think of it as an opportunity for the reward the next question actually foreign is for the wife the dead person died it's over it's right so this is the reward for the wife inshallah believe he was a good man she can make Dua for him and then she he will get the reward but no this is specifically a reward for the wife or for the Widow she can go back if there's a need like a medical need or or something like that but if if she's physically able to she should remain in the in the marital house and then people can come to her as I said but if she's unable to take care of herself then of course she can move to a place where she can take care of so for example one of the functions that the Masjid can happen that can have in the west is that is that if we have space or we have rooms or we can accommodate that people that are not able to live on their own that would be a possibility the head that starts after the the husband is right when the husband passes no no she can attend the diet that doesn't mean she's trapped in the house it means that when she sleeps at night she needs to return to that house no so she can participate in the funeral and she can go to the burial and all of that any anywhere it applies to any woman whose husband has died no not if she is able to stay and be on her own and I I don't Advocate sending the body to another country the Sunnah is that the the person is buried where they die and the prophet saws he said whoever dies in um a non-muslim lens dies a Shaheed even if he is a fesop so there is a great reward in living your Islam as a minority community and dying and we have enough facilities that this is our little daughter in Islam so we don't need to send the bodies back I don't advocate for that any more I had the questions okay no body um so sending the body to different places to be buried is just not the full Sunnah let's say there's it's not necessarily Haram but I mean it's not Haram at all but it's not the full Sunnah the Sunnah is that you know we're buried right you know right away let's say that there's a prominent uh Muslim figure or head of state and they die somewhere and then the king of Saudi Arabia says oh we're gonna we offer to have him buried in Medina well I mean obviously we should take them up on that offer that's a great opportunity to be buried amongst the sahaba and the so that might involve travel the body traveling and whatnot so there are circumstances and these are examples that we have seen But or you somebody's traveling let's say I'm just traveling on vacation or for work and I die in another country uh I can't be I'm not probably not going to be buried there they're probably going to have to arrange with the embassy to send me back to my origin country so there are circumstances in which that has to happen and the Sharia allows that I'm just saying the for families that live here we need to also feel that this is our home and if this is our home then this is where we're going to be buried and we have the facilities for that land where my fathers die land of thy Pilgrim's Pride Let Freedom Ring anything else about that the death okay the next is a longer question about divorce uh so I'm just going to read all the parts together and then we can talk about them is it a valid ground to get a divorce due to one spouse continuously and repeatedly denying the marital rights of their partner I'm assuming that this is uh in involved to intimacy this obviously is not due to any valid justifiable reason like health or the cases of occasional instances but rather revolving excuses many people tend to shy away from this topic but it could lead to destruction of marriages one way or another to avoid seeking a Haram route like an extramarital affair Etc is it a valid divorce reason if Communications and options have been exhausted you know when people for some reason when we talk about marriage we always talk about rights and if you talk if you base your marriage based on legal definitions I I doubt that you're going to have a very fruitful marriage because marriage is supposed to be based on love and mercy Allah says we created between you love and mercy of course the rules are there we have those rules because there has to be a way to answer these questions and if there's a problem we have to mitigate the problem but when people start to talk about what's my right uh what's her right I I it's not a business transaction it's not a it's not a business contract so we need to rethink that that being said the sexual act is a integral part of marriage because the sexual act its default is that it's Haram and then it is the marriage contract that makes it so obviously it's part of marriage but the sexual act is not by itself there are other forms of intimacy in a marriage so when people talk about I mean I'm deducing from the question maybe this is not exactly what the question is but let's say people come and they're saying you know we're not sexually active and one partner is refusing uh that towards the other partner Etc it's not just the ACT there are things around the act that we also need to discuss so intimacy is much larger than just sex so there has to be that intimacy there has to be that compassion there has to be that Mercy throughout the relationship when that starts to break down not now but very shortly thereafter this is when these type of things happen if one partner denies the sexual sexual intimacy towards the other partner for no reason yes it's a divorceable offense because this is something that is the right of each partner it is a protection that is why Allah created marriage what so Allah created these type of feelings that we have Etc any harm from the man towards the woman is a divorceable offense and harm is defined as physical harm verbal harm psychological harm emotional harm the books of the Malachi say the woman is divorced by any harm that befalls her and they'll say even if the man curses at his wife and says you daughter of a so-and-so you know araku you SOB or something like that even if he said that and she went to the cardi this would be a divorcible offense now that's the legal definition but when somebody comes to me for example and they have these problems my role is to try to reconcile well says and reconciling is better if that we can reconcile especially if there are children that are involved if people come to me and they say I can't stand her and I can't stand him and they start yelling which is unfortunate has happened even in this Masjid but in the basement alhamdulillah one time I had to kick somebody out of the mosque because it was just the the yelling was too much then okay in my mind I'm like well clearly they're gonna have to get divorced because there's no way to to reconcile they're yelling at each other in that case that's fine and the questioner says avoiding things like extramarital Affairs of course that's Haram and that's from the big sins the major sins from the kaber so the most disliked of the Halal acts with Allah is divorce the prophet sallallahu said so if you have to if that's the end result then you can get divorced and that's fine my advice is to try to seek reconciliation and to try to find out what's going on because I think that it's deeper than simply the sexual act is not taking place there might be something else that's going on okay are there any verses in the Quran or prophetic sayings that mention Women rights there are too many to mention the prophet saws that women are the partners of men to the half the other half of men I mean that's a huge statement even though it's only a few words the prophet saws saying is that women are the partners of men and if you read the life of the Companions and if you read the life specifically of the Prophet is he was with his wives you see that they were the prophet asked his wives advice all the time and they used to opine and they used to argue and they used to learn and they used to tease and she used to people would come to her after the passing of rasulullah to learn their Deen and one of the wisdoms that the prophet saws married at such a young age is that she grew up from a very young age in the house of the Prophet so she had all of this and then she her life was extended past way past the life of the Prophet salaam so she narrated on his behalf and she taught the ummah the women of the sahaba fought in the battles with the companions they took um the defense of Medina and they they defended in one instance uh during the battle of the I can't remember I think it was one of the wives of the Prophet maybe um I can't remember that who exactly but uh women and children were like in this Fortress that had the Surplus some of the supplies of in Medina and they saw that some of the quraish were nearby and Hassan the poet was with them so she said go down Hassan and kill this guy and our sins are I can't you know Hassan is a poet artist person he's like that's not for me she went down and she killed him and she protected all of the women and all of the children and all of the supplies then Allah says something very interesting in the Quran he says do not seek what I have given to the other to the man is their reward for what they have earned and for the woman is her reward what she for what she has done and in both of them is good so ask from Allah is there any way to make this thing stop echoing it's it's it's the volume is off every time when it's the meats on mute and everything not only do I have to see myself on delay but then I hear myself what's driving me crazy turn it off yeah okay you know somebody I can't that's I just it's driving me insane it's driving me insane so in this verse is saying that he has given special things to men and he has given special things to women so the man is proud that he's a man and and cherishes that and lives up to that and the woman is proud that she's a woman and she cherishes cherishes that and lives up to that and one of the signs of Yeoman is that men try to be like women and women try to be like men men dressed like women and women dressed like men this is why because Allah create this is one of the things that Allah created us in like Allah created us in time Allah is not going to come and say why did you live in the 2000s it's not there's no Tech Leaf we have no howl Alcoa this is when Allah decided us to exist he didn't want us to exist at the time of the sahaba one of the things that we have been created with is also our gender Allah is not going to come and says why aren't you a woman why aren't you a man we're not we're not responsible for that but but Allah created each one of us spiritually the same we have the same spiritual function towards Allah Allah rewards the man like he rewards the woman he rewards the woman like he rewards the man but we have different functions in society sometimes those functions overlap and sometimes those functions don't overlap so Allah Praises both the man and both the woman furthermore there are some people who are only referred to by their women by their by their mother like is and there's a whole chapter for Mariam in the Quran and when when when in Surat al-mariam when the the story is being narrated of of Mary alaihissalam um what does she say s she had wanted to dedicate the child for the service of the temple assuming that it was going to be a boy and then she finds out that she's giving birth to a girl and she says but the boy is not like the girl they say that this is an indication that the girl has a special quality that the boy does not have which which we know because a woman from the woman comes life itself we can't we can't life can't come from us it only can come from the woman so this verse actually is a praise of of of the girl in the in the idea of Mary later in the Quran Allah says Allah says I and I give as an example to all believers Asia the wife of pharaoh that she asked Allah for protection and for Paradise and then the verse after that foreign and then Allah also gives Mary as an example for all the Believers who protected her our chastising that Allah blew into the spirit which was Christ etc etc so Allah in these verses say I have look I'm giving all of humanity all believers an example who are these examples they're two women so this idea that the man is somehow better than the woman or something like that we really don't have that in Islam and in early Islam that wasn't really an issue in the early generation the generation of the early salaf it wasn't like that the women were uh just the other day I was reading this Hadith in Muslim the wording I forget but a woman a woman stood in the mosque and the narrator described her cheeks because she was she had the face of somebody who was involved in manual labor and unfortunately the the the word the narration escapes me what does that mean that means that her face wasn't covered how could the narrator describe how her face looked if she was her face was covered so that means her face was not covered with nikab but not just that I mean that's just a side point not just that but then she stood up right and she starts talking in the Masjid meaning that she's you know engaging there's also the famous uh the aunt of the Prophet um the prophet saws was in her house one day and he woke up and he laughed and she said you know why are you laughing and he said I saw a vision that my community will go out onto the Seas and he praised the people that will go out and fight down the Seas so she says I I want to be amongst them and he says inshallah you'll be amongst them so what happens with um later in the later in history after the passing of the Prophet during the life of mahawir she goes out onto the Mediterranean and they go to Cyprus and she dies as she lands and she's buried in Cyprus the mosque of um is in Cyprus you know one of the Companions and this is like something of Praise this is not this story that I'm telling you in tiramides and Muslim it's not like a side history story this is in our collections of Hadith so no later for many reasons uh you know usually men mess things up that's probably what happened and things became very patriarchal and women ended up being confined to the homes and not leaving the homes and so on and so forth that was cultural not religious and you know up until probably the early 1800s in most Muslim majority regions that's how women work so we inherit some of that and we think that this is Islam and then we start giving it a justification but if you look at the Quran and the Sunnah and if you look at the salaf the early salaf and how they lived no there was no difference I mean there's differences of course but I meant there's no one gender is better than another gender Allah Praises both Allah compensates both and both should be proud of the gender that they have been given as far as the rights are concerned if your question is are the rights involved for example in marriage yeah of course there are there are many Hadith that talk about the rights it's very very simple the woman only has to do like two things which is she has to keep the secrets of the house and she cannot deny intimacy for no reason that's about it everything else the man has to do the man has to provide food the man has to provide clothes the man has to provide shelter the man has to provide this the man has to provide that meaning he has to pay and that's why Allah says men have a degree over women a degree of responsibility the woman doesn't have to cook she doesn't have to clean she doesn't have to do anything the books of fix say that if a woman has a bed made of silk and she's sitting on her bed her husband can sit on the bed with her for her her enjoyment and then when she gets off the bed he must get off or else it's hard on for him to sit because it's silk I mean to what religion teaches this I mean tell me where what what religion has taught people this type of uh even in the books of I mean this is an outdated ruling but in the books of fish like in the mid-1800s it will say something like if a woman is used used to using tobacco then the man must provide her with her tobacco in addition to all of the things she's used to because this is something that's new that came so what does that mean other than the the ruling of tobacco has evolved that means that things that a woman is used to before she gets married the husband needs to be able to provide those things so from rules and responsibility if you want to live your life like that you know find the man that's going to do that and the woman can just sit at home and do nothing but but this is not how we are today we would reject that kind if we found a woman like that the women would be upset and if we found a man like that we would be upset so also these roles these societal roles have changed and there's nothing wrong with us changing and adapting with that because they are under the principles of the Quran and the Sunnah okay another question another topic altogether is it possible that the Buddha is amongst the unknown prophets yes of course and Allah has told us about some prophets and not told us about most prophets so the MBA that we know are very very few compared to all of the uh profits that were actually sent and every Community was sent a prophet Allah so our teachers taught us that when we when we have a question like this we say and the Buddha if he was a prophet Allah or if he was a prophet I'm the first to believe in him and I believe that he was a prophet because I mean it's impossible it's one of the most populous most impactful uh religions traditions on the face of Earth it's impossible that that came out of nothing and most of these ancient people ancient religions come from some kind of why that people didn't just make it up the things that are made up are those um you know animists and and polytheists that you find in different Islands or different you know you know tribal areas in Africa those are things that are made up but things like ancient the ancient Egyptians uh ancient Greeks ancient Romans uh the hindic world and those those are all came from religion if you look at ancient Egyptian stuff and the hieroglyphics and the time I mean that didn't just make that up that came from something there was some wahi at some point and it became distorted and that's what we believe about all of traditions all religious Traditions so yes it's very possible that the Buddha was a prophet is it very possible that Krishna was a prophet it was very possible that uh uh all of these ancient sages were from the MBA and if they were no thanks yeah re rebirth reincarnation is a completely fabricated belief there is no it in the religion of God it doesn't belong because the the belief of rebirth negates and and belief in Yeoman Kiama is one of the fundamental things that God came to send the prophets to teach Humanity aside from toheed there is a he said so this idea of reincarnation yeah this is completely new fabricate we would say that this was not part of the Buddha's original teaching and for some reason it's very popular Muslims uh where was I it was a summary was in Virginia last week Muslims that want to believe in this for some reason it's a really big fitna yeah but would it be as tell Hayden but to haid also necessitates that there is heseb not that we're just sort of going on and on and on it gets distorted over time in different ways uh in the Christian World it gets distorted with the trinity in the Jewish World it gets distorted through anthropomorphism in the dharmic world it gets uh distorted through things like Karma or Dharma and reincarnate yeah so these are just ways that we would say our critique would be that these are ways of distortion Islam maintains its pure monotheism because there's also no other religion that has a very pure and clearly articulated monotheism like Islam Today our monotheism has no anthropomorphism whatsoever we have an allergic reaction to anthropomorphism and that's why all of these big theological debates that inside Muslim sects revolve around you know the hand of Allah Allah sitting on the throne and stuff like that because we have a allergic reaction if there's anything that's anthropomorphic because anthropomorphism is one of the ways that the religions before us can become distorted yeah so we don't believe in rebirth and reincarnation I mean rebirth in the Senate we believe in Resurrection of course will be resurrected but this idea that there's just this cycle of karma that we don't believe in and nor would we say that it was part of the original message is sports betting Haram I mean come on yeah sports betting is Haram we don't bet we don't gamble we don't bet uh don't waste your money and if you have a gambling problem please call 1-800 whatever the 1-800 number is for the game because it is an addiction and it is a problem and every time there's an announcement or an advertisement for gambling they always have to by law say if you have a gambling addiction you know go to this website or go to this number did you ask this question [Laughter] yeah it is it you're right it is it is much more prevalent when we were growing up it was it was not um yeah the thing about fun I mean I'm sure it's fun you know drinking alcohol is fun and you know getting high as fun and all that kind of stuff and I don't think that people do these things with a bad intention but for us the level of Haram and Halal is not about if we're having fun or not nor does Allah want us to be miserable either but but you know the Haram is the Haram it's not about how I feel about it if it's Haram it's Haram and there are other ways that we can uh entertain ourselves so betting betting sports betting gambling all that stuff is Haram Cricket man there are Halal ways of of of uh having Financial prizes in games and sportsmanships in the Sharia but it will not look like betting but it's it's you know there can be a prized person there has to be a third person involved there's a whole fifth about it so if you guys want we can talk about that and we can you know we can try to revive that Sunnah in the Masjid Our Tattoos Haram in Islam can you pray and go umra and Hajj with tattoos for the sunnis the tattoo is Haram why not because of the ink and not because of the design the tattoo is Haram if if it involves bringing up the blood from the blood vessel injecting the ink with the blood and then re-injecting that back under the dermis of the skin because the blood in the Sharia is considered najis so if I take blood out and then inject it back underneath my skin I.E tattoo then this is like I have this permanent piece of najessa of ritual impurity on my hand so it's Haram for that reason but something like henna is not Haram if you got like a henna design or if there was I mean I don't really know much about the tattoo world I mean I know it's a big world and I should know more about it but I don't but if there was a way that somebody could just have an ink design without the Blood Part it wouldn't be Haram but if it's doubtful that yeah we can do the ink but there's a chance that there can be blood because of that chance we would say that it was Haram because it's too much of a high probability or a chance that an adjuster can get involved I believe but I'm not sure I haven't verified this I believe for the shias they have a different approach to tattoos but for us for all the Sunday schools it's all it's all Haram for the reasons that I've indicated uh uh if somebody feels the urge to do this I advise you to get a hidden because there's also the idea of like what happens if you don't like it after all I never understand that or when you get old like you've ever been seen an older person like one of those hippies from the 60s and 50s now with the tattoos I mean they got to be wondering they got to be doubting why they did that I mean I doubt why they're doing that so I I think you should go for the hidden around or temporary tattoos you know the sticker tattoo you remember when we were kids used to give them bubble gum used to put them in wet the sponge and stuff like that you know just try it out and then it goes away but the henna is not Haram because it's water soluble and after a while it goes away it doesn't involve any blood and things like that uh about now what happens if you have a tattoo knowing that it's Haram and all of what we just said now what happens if you have a tattoo are you supposed to cut your limb off no how else do you have to live with it and ask Allah for talban Allah will forgive you insha Allah and there's a principle that Allah forgives what is continually done in error but he does not forgive in the first instance meaning that when you first engage in the act you have to make tauba from that but now it's Continuum much it's on me it's continuously there does that mean at every second I'm receiving a sin no inshallah is merciful and can forgive so in this case if you have a tattoo you still you still can go to you have to go to Hajj because it's an obligation if you're financially and physically able what happens if you're not Muslim and you're all tattooed and then you become a Muslim it's the same thing you'll be forgiven for that and that will be excused so on and so forth but uh really really caution for not other than the Haram aspect I really caution against the tattoo thing it's again another thing like the sports betting it's becoming very popular tattoos and it's becoming very popular in the Muslim world too so people will get a tattoo like their name in Arabic and then there are these people that go to the Muslim the Arab world to get Arabic tattoos and then the tattoo artist messes up on purpose so they say I want to get like like uh like sweetheart but in Arabic so the the two artists will write Anna kelp I'm a dog in Arabic and I've seen these type of things happen I don't know why I had to say that but I just if you put if you put a picture you put a picture online yeah it's it's that with the same the same concept would happen yeah so sometimes things get out of hand unbeknownst to us uh so you have to make terrible from them and make the effort because Allah the prophet saws whoever in invents a bad Sunnah gets its sin and the sin of those who act on it so we also need to be careful uh and the tawba has to has to occur do you need another question do you need an Imam to be present to give al-hola does Court divorce end Islamic marriage this may be unfair question to you as it is legal is a woman initiated divorce and I wish when people translate let's just translate it like that because there's a false assumption that only men can divorce there can be all types of divorce but they're just called different things a man's initiated divorce is a talaq a woman's initiated verse divorce is a court initiated divorce is so so all of those terminate the marriage is not what a divorce is so they just call different things because there are different procedures so the hola is when the woman wants to go get divorced she goes to the khadi she tells the khadi uh I want to divorce this man then the man the khadi grants her the hola in which case she has to return the Maha to the man okay that's so what does the Imam the Miskin Imam what do I have to do with the Quran so no the hola is a woman initiated divorce that has to take place in front of the judge does the court divorce and the Islamic marriage the court divorce confirms the Islamic divorce just like the court here I'm talking about the Western civil court just like the Civil Court confirms the Islamic marriage what do I mean by that so somebody comes to the Masjid and they want to get married so we perform the nikah in Islam is verbal the the bride makes the offer and then the groom accepts why does the bride make the offer because the bride has the power of the contract not the man so by the woman beginning the contract or her Welly or her um uh Guardian she controls the contract and the condition of the contracts that's what people don't people in the west are like oh it's so unromantic and it doesn't it has something to do with romance this is a contract and this is how she protects herself but anyway so the woman makes an offer based on the Mahar and the Quran and the Sunnah et cetera Etc and then the man agrees verbally and then I come down and I have a piece of paper and then we write down the nicker and we sign it this document that we wrote is confirming the marriage that already happened so where is the real nikah it's the verbal contract that happens according to the Quran and Sunnah so the piece of paper whether it be a piece of paper that we have amongst us in the Masjid or it's the marriage license that they bring to me and then I sign or remember defy signs or whatever that is a confirm confirmation of the nikah that took place so then the reverse is also true if they they want to get divorced for example but they're going to have to also get divorced civilly because based on the divorce decision there will be certain tax implications distribution of property custody so on and so forth wanting to remarry all of these things a man and a woman they come to me and the man says I want to they agree that they're going to get divorced and the men is going to do the divorce so I say okay tell your wife you are divorced so he says you are divorced in English or he says in Arabic the divorce now has taken place so they're going to go to the court and they're going to confirm it by making the divorce on a piece of paper or the opposite they've agreed that she is the one that is going to be divorcing him in which case she has to return the Mahar whatever the Mahatma was they're going to go to court and they're going to sign the divorce now of course this is theoretical because when people get divorced they never do anything together they want to fight and they want to kick and they want to scream and they want to destroy each other and they want to bury each other alive and all of these type of things that's another issue altogether but but what happens if we hit the question a couple came to me I'm not going to tell you they are a couple came to me many years ago the Masjid and they wanted to there was a divorce being naive I try to reconcile the minute I even mentioned reconcile I made them even more mad I wish I never even said that word they started I you know I said maybe there's a one percent chance that you no not even 0.001 I said okay okay I'm sorry so I had an individual conversation with each of them uh he told me what he provided with the Mahar and your financial situation and then she told me privately her version and I reconciled the numbers and I came up with this was going to be him divorcing her and I came up with what I thought was a fair settlement according to the Sharia the settlement that I offered it happened to be what he wanted and she thought that this is uh I I'm I'm a man and I'm siding with the man and blah blah blah and I'm gonna go to court and in America I get 50 I said yes but you understand that 50 of nothing is nothing so you think you're going to get 50 this is not Bill Gates it's your your divorcing they went to court and my rule is when people come to me for a marriage divorce uh Etc no lawyers involved no no disrespect to any of the Lord if anybody goes to a lawyer I'm out I have nothing to do with it whatsoever or do I nor do I get involved in the courts because I believe that this is all a big scam this whole marriage divorce lawyer thing they just think about it the lawyer no offense to remember not a member of everyone except they remember if I the lawyer is one of the few jobs that you still get paid when you're wrong and you still get paid when you lose think about that it doesn't matter which side went you're still going to have to pay the lawyer Haram all of the money look what happened they both went she went to a lawyer so he had to get a lawyer and they duked it out in court for over a year and they spent combined something like 150 almost 200 000 in legal fees and at the end of the day the judge ruled exactly exactly with what I said a year ago and I didn't get paid a cent and it turned out that she was legally still married to her previous husband in another state so she was found guilty of bigamy it was a very big you know sort of scandalous type of situation so unfortunately my point isn't telling you the story unfortunately that when people come and they want to get divorced they really don't they've kind of they're fed up with each other and they think that if they go to the courts there's each person is going to get their right and I'm telling you it doesn't happen like that Haram that you waste all of this money we are more than happy to help you settle uh the situation in a respectable way but we have clear guidelines so to come back to the question if somebody gets divorced in the courts yes this is a cessation of the divorce islamically because the Islamic divorce happens verbally just like the mayor just like the contract of marriage happens verbally well I can try okay do you need a witness for the divorce very good question you don't need a witness for the divorce islamically but now most Muslim majority countries are introducing this as part of the law because there is too much confusion that happens so I would say for us yes like we have two witnesses for the marriage contract we have to have two witnesses for the divorce uh I don't yeah Islamic view of will yeah we might as well just say can you teach us about Islam I mean that's a huge question Islamic Wills uh well there's a couple things I will say in the beginning what is the the percentages or the fractions of the distribution of wealth that's laid out in the Quran in the Sunnah this is for wealth that is not claimed during somebody's lifetime so let's say I'm leaving the mosque and I you know I get in a car accident and I die so whatever I have lying around that money that little money has to be given to my wife and my sons and my daughters according to the percentages but let's say in my lifetime uh I gave a gift to my son or I gave a gift to my daughter or I gave something or I wrote this piece of property in my wife's name this is not part of the will because this is a transaction that's taken place as far as the will is concerned it depends on who The Descendants are so each situation is different you have to see who is you know if it's a married couple so on and so forth how many children there are are there any relatives that are left and then we would have to determine it based on that the will in America is not necessarily the will in Islam that's also another thing so the will in in America is uh something that actually comes later after the death process the will that we're thinking about is what happens with the money and how it's distributed so my advice is that you should sit down with a estate planner you or you can find a simple will online if you're young but there should be a will that dictates how you want your wealth to be distributed because if you don't do that you can be taxed and the money can end up getting lost through the American system because in every state they have their own fractions inheritance distribution fractions that are I don't even know where they come from maybe English law or common law or something like that they have their own fractions and you can be open to tax being taxed in the American wheel you also need to talk about things like your medical directive uh Power of Attorney to a spouse or to a relative or to somebody in case there are decisions that need to be made at the end but don't put in your American will how you want to be buried and this is not because they're going to open this will a month after you die it's going to be too late you're going to already be buried so you need to also arrange with your local Muslim Community Center or your Masjid and understand what the protocols are for burial and washing and um Genesis and all of that kind of stuff so that we can handle those things for you so is the prenup here basically the financial distribution in the case of divorces this is what they mean by prenup you remember a fact so by law in this country the prenup is about finances by finances in the case of divorce yeah so the prenup therefore in if as so defined is basically the Mahar and what happens with the with the Maha I mean that's what happens that is the Islamic contract so here we're just calling it a prenup so if people feel that the prenup is a way to protect themselves then sure I mean there's nothing wrong with that because marriage is a contract and if both parties agree to this as part of the contract it's fine there's nothing wrong with that because the let's say you know a couple comes to the message and we do the nikah and you know I have my little piece of paper and we sign it this is not going to be enforceable in the court that's the problem so what ends up happening is that there are many cases in which one party takes advantage of another and the woman usually is the one that doesn't you know get her rights uh protected so in this case there's nothing wrong with that what do you mean by not children do some people want to include things about children in the prenup do you mean custody uh okay sure but yeah but I'm just I'm just trying to understand the prenup thing so of course it's what I said is right I know you don't have to tell me that I'm just kidding because we were just talking about prenup I think last night you were mentioning it to me [Music] okay so by will I'm going to say that 50 of my estate goes to iccp yeah uh this is called a Wasilla which is a bequest in the Sharia the bequest can only be one third of the estate if it is to exceed one third of the estate then it must include the permission of all of the people that were going to uh inherit so if I get if you know all my children and my wife together and I say I want when I die 50 of everything to come to iccp so real can you know do with it what he sees fit and they're like yes we love ICC we were fine then I can do that one-third without anyone's permission if it's going to exceed one-third it needs to include the permission and the uh affirmation of those who would inherit that's a good question well the report will recognize it if we've drafted in a legal will so we we should do that and this would be a wonderful thing if we find an estate lawyer that the community can work with and we have like a workshop I went to one several years ago and I was very very beneficial and at least in the state of Maryland it's there are many options and there are many protections and you can put a whole host of things in your will uh you would be surprised it's very very interesting so I highly recommend that we we think of a community of doing that it'd be great if we find a Muslim estate lawyer too maybe there'll be more understanding there is in our community awesome yeah okay we could do it together but I meant because at the end of the day whatever I'm saying you need to take this and go to a lawyer and make a legal instrument so we need a lawyer at some point in in time to do it foreign fireplace and uh I know in the talmudic law there is uh clear or not there is a discussion of percentages I in the gospels in the in the Christian Bible there is no reference so that would probably be in canon law I don't I don't know uh the canon law I believe is taken from Justinian law which was the ancient Roman legal system and I think added they added to that so in the judeo-christian world I think the Jews probably have more to say about it than than the Christians and for us yes it's you know it's very it's it's actually considered its own discipline even if you study it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to study inheritance law inheritance laws is is very complicated and it's very mathematical and not very complicated but it's its own discipline was there something else from online okay well I have this up now so uh okay I'm a Muslim another question I'm a Muslim born and bred in North Africa the Middle East I got married overseas under Islamic law I now live in North America with the permission of my first wife I decided to take a second wife and got married under Islamic law I have an open relationship with both my wives don't say open relationship because that means something else in the context today I have an open relationship with both my wives and we coexist given that I live in North America and laws here are different with Islamic law take precedence so you got married to a second wife in another country Muslim majority country let's say would the permit would the knowledge you know acknowledgment or permission of your first wife so that means that that second marriage there's no question marks about the validity of that second marriage so you the second marriage is valid and you owe that wife the rights that are owed to her like you owe to the first wife that you have to split the resources so on and so forth but what you're not going to be able to do is you're not going to be able to bring that second wife to America as your second wife and that is where the problem emerges so living in this country only if you're not not living between two countries living in this country only and having more for a man having more than one wife it's not going to work because bigamy being married to more than one person in this country is a crime and if I if I marry a second wife or a third wife here in this country and she is here in this country I have already harmed this second and third wife or fourth wife because there are no there are very there are fewer legal protections for her than there are for my actual wife Financial legal protections that she doesn't have uh maintenance legal protection uh if the kids are involved inheritance and that's up so on and so if I wanted to get away from those things I could easily and that's why I do not Advocate or even I would go as far as to say in in in except in very rare circumstances I would not think it's permissible for in this country to be married more than to one wife even if it's with people's permission there are circumstances in certain communities in this country widows inner city situations where I understand that polygamy is very common and can and can solve the problem but I would still try to find other Solutions but that's my own opinion it's not necessarilya's opinion as far as the getting back to the question uh given that I live in North America and the laws here would Islamic law take precedence I mean it depends what the question is really about are you asking was the marriage correct the marriage was correct there's nothing wrong with that you've been engaged in anything wrong uh can you bring this other wife here no you're not going to be able to bring her as your wife and if you bring her not as your wife but as you know let's say she has a green card or a citizenship and she comes here then you're going to start to get into this difficult situation where you are harming her without her knowing about it because you haven't given her those protections because the default understanding of the contract is that the man is going to protect the wife assume certain responsibility in the marriage contract I mean and assume certain responsibilities so uh the marriage is fine you have your shitty obligations you've done nothing wrong but you have to make sure that you maintain the rights and the protection of both wives is what I would say but somebody meant on the the group chat somebody said Noreen Rahman is an attorney who does estate planning she's part of the community millenniumattorney.com so for those are on Zoom the link for the lawyer is there okay the last question I have on the paper but of course if there are other questions you can take them there was an announcement at Juma the two iccp youth graduated as uh office of Quran can you please explain what it takes to achieve this and the benefits in this day and age this is a sacrifice from other studies how does one from your experience balance these objectives and the two youth are of Ethiopian origin uh and you've mentioned this previously in your Sierra series please recount these for our benefits okay so memorizing the Quran uh basically entails learning how to recite the verses of the Quran according to the rules of tajweed which is not so difficult because there are many repeated words and phrases in the Quran and once you you know once you kind of get going you kind of know how things are supposed to sound and then you've got to sit your butt down and memorize the Quran so you probably memorize a page a day and if you go with the most half of the Medina musafir will probably take you about a year and eight to ten months a little less than two years to memorize the entire report and if you memorize a page a day and of course the most difficult thing about memorizing is not memorizing but it's about reviewing because you start memorizing boom boom boom boom boom and then you go back to review the Sheikh says well let me hear from the beginning you're like uh uh so we have to go back and it just requires that time and that purity of intention Allah says that we have made the Quran easy to be remembered and to be memorized but who is there to reflect upon this so it requires a pure intention and it's doable and you know millions of people before us from the time of the Prophet saws have memorized the Quran most people that memorize the Quran are non-arabs might not even even understand the verses of the Quran their full meaning but they have retained within their hearts the the Quran of course memorizing the Quran is a great act in itself because it is one of the signs of the veracity of the Quran that it's easy to memorize that it's easy to uh to be held in someone's memory and it is a protection for that person in this dunian in the Hereafter and it's also protection and forgiveness for many of the relatives that they will be able to intercede on their behalf on your so you know may Allah make them firm and may may he make our memorization and our dedication to the Quran firm as well the idea what happens when you start memorizing the Quran is that you just start living this you know relationship with the Quran that you're always turning to it you're always thinking of a passage you're always going back to review you're trying out something new you find somebody so can you listen can you take the most often just I want to read the Surah to you or this just can you just correct me if I forget any and you you just you have a relationship with the Quran it becomes something that's very special to you that you're always going back to it you're always reading it and uh Masha Allah as far as balance and and so so on and so forth I mean who cares about the balance just just take two years and do it uh there's nothing wrong with that do we live a balanced life no we spend too much time doing this too much time doing that so memorizing the Quran actually doesn't take that much time it's just about Dedication that every day I'm gonna do this because you're not going to sit down and for six seven hours be reading the Quran you're going to memorize a little then review a little then you have to go out do something else and then I mean there's only so much that you can humanly do in one day so you probably will be spending two to four hours per day you know doing that if you don't know any Arabic or how to read the Quran it might take you longer in the beginning because you need to know those parts as well but what you really need to do is just sit down and dedicate the time to doing it as far as balance and and studies that the kids are back and now they're in school they're fine and uh so what's up what's a year or two extra in their academic Journey they were able to pick up the Quran along the way it was worth it so don't look at it as a balanced and this and that look at it that I have the opportunity to do something great and I'm going to do it are there any mem uh Ethiopia well next slide inside yes so the technique of memorizing is that in in a by hockey there's a Hadith that the prophet saws says if you memorize the Quran five by five you will not forget so when they came to print the Quran in the modern world they printed the page of the Quran to have 15 lines and this is the from the Ottomans the ottomans are the ones that used to write the handwritten Quran they used to write it in this way that each page would begin with a verse and end with a verse and each page would have 15 lines other than the page that has the transition from the surahs because the Surah title might might make it less and of course the first two pages the fat and the first five verses of baqarah are typically by themselves and then the last page will have so there's more space given to that but basically all of the other pages are 15. so where did the 15 come from it came from this hadees that this is how the Quran should be memorized so if you memorize a page a day or if you build up to being able to memorize a page a day the page is 15 lines so you can start by doing the first five lines and then five and five to ten and then adding another five fifteen of course it might not exactly be five because maybe you need to get to the sixth line for the a because the a might cross over to a line but in general that's the philosophy or the I do not the philosophy that's the idea behind it um one way is to just read from the beginning to the end over and over and over and over again one way is to memorize the first verse then memorize the second verse and recite them together then remember as the third verse and then recite them there are different ways of doing it but the bottom line the upshot is any type of memorization requires repetition so whether you read the whole page over and over or whether you go verse by verse the ideas you have to repeat and then after you've locked in the memory today you're gonna have to recall it in the coming days so you have to review so people that memorize the Quran or are in the process of memorizing the Quran they'll probably tell you that they spend more time reviewing than they do memorizing or at some point they'll spend more time reviewing and then the people that finish the Quran they have to continue to review it so they're going to review between three and five juice per day because if they've memorized it it's quick you know each juice will probably take 15 to 20 minutes so within an hour to an hour and a half they can easily read between three and five just every day and you need that kind of volume to be able to go through it over and over again but it becomes easy and then you know mashallah you're finishing the Quran every 10 days or every week to 10 days so on and so forth so in a person's life it wouldn't be far-fetched to say that they read the Quran a thousand to two thousand times in their life in that way if somebody's asking about memorization classes at iccp for adults or tajweed classes that's ennis's department so Ennis has his class so should reach out to Ennis now that he's back he can tell you what the classes are the questioner also asked about Ethiopia because the the two young men you know may Allah bless them and bless their parents they're from Ethiopia um Ethiopia is the the place of the first Hijra right the first migration took place the first two migrations took place to abyssinia and the companions went uh at the time of Mecca when the Muslims were persecuted in Mecca and the prophet saws said go to al-habash to abyssinia because there is a righteous King who does not harm anyone no one is is unjustly treated and the negus of abyssinia the najashi he receives the sahaba and he intercedes uh in the the conflict because the quraish also came with the sahaba to try to dissuade the najeshi from taking them and the najeshi upon hearing what Islam teaches about Christ and Mary Etc he accepted them and later on the najeshi ends up that particular ends up becoming Muslim and when he passed away the prophet saws and prayed the Janessa prayer absent and as a prayer on him in in Medina but in the time when the Muslims lived in abyssini in the very beginning under that particular najeshi the najeshis um kingdom was attacked and the Muslims that lived in abyssinia fought with the najashi in the army of the najeshi to repel the enemy and zubair uh was awarded he was given a spear as an award for his Valor in battle and this is a very important episode in the syrup because it teaches us how to live as a protected minority in a non-muslim majority which is the for us and most people that live in the west this is our model love of the Homeland participation in the defense of the Homeland obeying of the laws so on and so forth life was so good for the Muslims in abyssinia that many of them did not leave even after the prophet saws migrated from Mecca to Medina there were still companions that remained companions were born there or they had children there rather and the Muslim Community in Ethiopia today many of them can trace their lineage all the way back to that early community the prophet saws spoke some words of uh the the length aramharic at the time or or whatever was the prop common language at the time he received gets gifts from the najeshi he was given a donkey he was given you know I think clothes socks leather socks so on and so forth so there was good relationship between the prophet salaam and the people of Abyssinian and the Ethiopian people for that reason have a special place and our hearts for housing and and taking the the first group of persecuted Muslims a question online one of the Germans was about seeking knowledge do you have any advice about sequencing this for someone who wants to consolidate his knowledge in a structured way well from the person who asked the question I think there are scientists or a data scientist um you have to we have three big buckets we have the Islam Iman and Sen so we have the uh Sharia related Sciences we have belief and we have ethics so one way is to help you know drop knowledge in each of those buckets in equal amounts if you don't know anything for example to make sure that you have a little bit of knowledge of how you practice your faith have a little bit of knowledge of the kind of things that constitute faith and then have some ethical principles so on and so forth and I think that if you come to the Masjid frequently and we have enough uh content on our YouTube channel that if you consume these things for the next year if you like watch the video a day or something like that you probably will have a good basic understanding of the dean because we've talked about a lot of stuff over the last eight nine ten years at the Masjid and especially during covid when everything was recorded and we really started paying attention with the YouTube channel you know I myself have taught entire books multiple books that are all recorded on YouTube and you can follow them you can buy these books from Amazon it's going to cost you less than a hundred dollars to buy all the books that I taught and I mean I'm just saying what I've done not to mention tariff before me and now Imam referee many lectures on tafsir we've had one-off topics on different topics uh um so on and so forth so I've taught the Sierra the signs of the end of time the uh the 99 names of Allah's book the 40 principles of Islam what am I doing now the 40 Hadith now we know and the whole host all of the jummah khudbas so that would be one structure one way to do it um and if you find our content on the YouTube channel you'll be able to know what bucket you're PL you know you're plugging in the knowledge and that kind of bucket um that being said it's probably helpful to have an a a a a structure like a like a Islam 101 or like an intro to Islam approach on my website I have a class called the Muslim mind which I've tried to do I think I have 23 or 24 audio lectures which I tried to answer that question to give people a framework of how to think about Islam is like 360 degree maybe that was something like that would be helpful or a book that does that uh the vision of Islam by William shiddick ideals and realities of Islam by whom I studied with it at University that's a very good book ideals and realities of Islam um the vision of Islam is basically a commentary on the Hadith of Gabriel uh those two books are usually the books that I I would recommend that people start out with to give them that kind of framework uh uh that they will need to be able to have this sort of structured approach to understanding Islam any other questions is it actual time [Music] did you say that nine okay okay so we'll I'm going to end the the stream so everybody online we love you thank you for joining us we'd like to see you next time donate to iccp alhamdulillah um foreign
