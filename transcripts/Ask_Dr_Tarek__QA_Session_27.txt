Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. These are the blessed days of and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that these are the best days of the year and the devotional works in these days are multiplied and the best of the devotional works that we have the best of that we have is the seeking of knowledge. So we ask Allah subhana wa ta'ala to make this a gathering of seeking of knowledge to place it in our scale of good deeds inshallah to show us what is right and to help us stay firm to it to show us what is wrong and to help us avoid it inshallah. Uh there are not that many questions so I'll go down the list but I think we wanted to also talk a little bit about the so I'll I'll save that for for the end. Uh so somebody asked, I started a garden for the first time this year and I'm wondering what the guidance is for killing pests. I have so many uh I don't know the aphids on my plants eating them. Ironically, I'm also trying to teach my son not to kill Allah's creatures like walking around ants and not destroying any hills. So of course when it comes to farming you have to take precautions uh so that the crops grow or else the crops won't grow and or the whatever the flowers or the fruits uh will not grow properly. So there is nothing wrong with taking those type of precautions because that's the natural life that Allah subhana t had created uh you know animal life the animal kingdoms and whatnot and there is violence you know in that natural uh life and we have to find a way to to mitigate that. Of course within that there are different ways there are legal ways and illegal ways. So obviously the first order of business would to stick to stick with those legal methods and not to use illegal pesticides and things like that that can cause multiple harm and that sort of repel rather than necessarily kill. Uh but all of that is within within the permissibility of the or else we wouldn't be able to garden and to farm. So this is something that is is natural and accepted and uh is not a violation sort of our principles of our of our ethics. That's different than me walking around and seeing an insect and killing an insect. I have no need to kill an insect when I'm walking around. That's different. That's sort of our manifestation of mercy. Um you know if you found like a creature in the mosque, you know, you could take it outside rather than kill it. That's different. But when you're trying to grow food uh then that needs to be uh there are certain protocols that need to be in place to protect that. How should Muslims understand the rise of artificial intelligence in light of Islamic teachings especially with regards to concerns about the loss of human fra ethical discernment and potential connections to end times prophecies in the Quran and the Hadith. So artificial intelligence has actually been around for quite some time. This is not necessarily something that's so new. Uh a lot of the services that we use just as citizens uh already integrate in them artificial intelligence. So the first thing is to recognize that it's a growing thing. It's not like it just appeared now. I think what's what's appeared now are the the sort of the mega investment into artificial intelligence and maybe it's open use by people uh different sort of chat bots and and AI tools uh and whatnot. So it's happening. It's not it's not something that can be undone. It's happening. It's here to stay and and it will continue to grow. Now the thing about artificial intelligence is that or or the technology in general is that the good of it is good and the bad of it is bad. So there are good uses and important uses of those type of artificial intelligence tools. Um however there are nefarious uses of the artificial intelligence and then therefore that raises certain ethical concerns and unfortunately as a as a community we are really way way behind in those type of discussions in in contemplating what are we going to do with AI. we're way way behind and uh it's it's sort of like a a massive wave of of this new trend that's coming towards us and it's going to you know it's already or already has come and we really don't have we haven't had a conversation about the ethics around it uh the dos and the don'ts and things like that because because technology is not eth is not value neutral I mean there are ethics involved uh in the technology and how it's used so That's one comment. One comment is that we're definitely behind as a community. I mean globally as a global community. The other thing is um the problem with another problem with the AI is that AI is just as biased as all other type of of technologies. And the the examples that we've had in using AI show, you know, a gross misunderstanding of Islam and and the kind of available information what's available about Islam online. And we have no alternative. we have no alternative you know Islamically led or ethicallyled uh AI tool and uh I have found when it comes to Islam specifically AI is very very deficient and and and not very intelligent at all actually and then the third thing is that I find a lot of people that use AI for different they use AI for menial tasks or or basic tasks and I think what I'm noticing is that people outsource their own thinking their basic thinking and that's I think very dangerous. If you can't critically think, if you can't articulate yourself and you learn how to critically think and how to uh how to coherently communicate and you think that AI is going to do that for you, it's going to create a problem in the long run. It's going to create a big problem. Uh and people will become dumber because they will you they will rely on the AI tool to do the things that we should basically do as human beings. So, I'm definitely concerned about that aspect. And I a lot of people in my in my work environment, they use AI tools and I've it's very I find it very disappointing. I mean, it's never accurate the way I think it's supposed to be accurate. And um I realize that the the problem is not necessarily AI. It's the user. It's the person that's using it, the person that's putting in the prompts. And people just think that, oh, AI will just do it and it will make life easier. Theoretically, that's the case. If you have you could if you have a task you know 10 moving parts uh AI can you know alleviate many you know half of those parts and half of the time that's a big time saver but you have to know what to how to use it to be trained how to use it to ask the right kind of prompt so on and so forth. So those are just some of the random thoughts I have about AI. The upshot is that it's definitely an ethical concern because there are a lot of nefarious uses for AI and um not just nefarious uses but they're just ethical concerns in general in the use of AI in different aspects of our life and therefore we as a community have to be able to talk about it and discuss it which we haven't um and you know we tend to be conservative with the adoption of new things because we fear fundamental mentally that our you know paradigm or our ethical paradigm it would our ethical paradigm is very important to us. So we become very concerned that something can breach that ethical paradigm uh and and turn things upside down. So the fact that Muslims tend to be conservative with the adoption of new technologies in and of itself is not a bad thing. Not ju not just because something exists doesn't mean that we have to adopt it and use it but rather we should contemplate it, think about it, develop some kind of parameters. Um, of course and and and and jump into that space and and develop our own type of AI tools that have those ethics and those uh those parameters set within them. Um, can we do Neil fast on Fridays other than Ramadan? You can fast on any day uh of the week uh outside of Ramadan except that the days we're not supposed to fast like the days of Eid and the days of the the days after the um the the prohibition or the hadith about not fasting on a Friday is if somebody believes that fasting on that day is a individually more meritorious than fasting on another day which obviously the questioner uh does not does not fall into that category. So if you have the opportunity to fast, you should fast. If you have the opportunity to do some kind of, you should do it. Do we have to fast until we perform the sacrifice on? Uh no. I mean is a day of uh is a day of eating. You the the hadith is that you don't eat before you go to to Eid prayer. It's a sunnah to withhold eating until you pray theid prayer on the day of and the and the opposite for the sunnah is that you break your fast right away in the morning before you go to however that being the case you have to understand that the sunnah for the is that it's right after the sun rises. So our here it's it's it's a little bit different because we have delayed the prayer several hours. So this sunnah might be a little bit difficult uh to to uh to implement. I'll talk about the the at the end. I think there's a couple more questions. If a woman does not have a welli father or relative from the paternal side of her family, who can serve as a welli for her for the nikah and a member of the community step in or a male relative from the maternal side of her family? So the woman that does not have an immediate male uh relative which is the category of the wii then the you know the local imam or the muti uh or a judge can take place of that you know anybody from the community that's respected can take that place if the woman is in need of of a for following that opinion and of course in the of Abuhanifa the the woman of age can marry herself so that's another way around around that issue Uh, someone has questions about inheritance from her family in Egypt as well as guidance for her will, trust for her descendants here in the US, general guidelines for inheritance. Well, the context here is very different than the context in a country like Egypt. In Egypt, you know, the the inheritance laws are pretty straightforward. They for Muslims, they follow the Sharia distributions. So that's, you know, that's pretty straightforward. Here, however, it is different. you know, you have to have your financial affairs in order. Uh because if you don't do that while you're alive, when you die, uh the state or the federal government can end up taking portions of your assets. So that here we we have a different approach which is we need to have estate planning. Um whether you create some kind of trust for your family or whether you kind of just you know you you list the recipients on or you put their names on on different accounts or different properties and of ownership so that things which what we want is that when we pass inshallah the financial things just kind of automatically take place and it's not a problem. That requires an estate a state lawyer and whoever asking that question they can reach out to me privately and we can discuss the details. Actually that's all the questions. The last question is a repeat of the artificial intelligence. Okay. But somebody told me that a lot of people are asking about the so thought we could talk about the No, no, no. On the day of the sunnah is not to eat until you finish the Eid prayer. Oh, they don't break the fast. I don't understand that. When when you wake up in the morning of the day of Eid, you eat right away. Okay. So, you don't bring the sunnah. No, it's just a sunnah is to wait to eat until after you finish the Eid prayer. Oh, so what is background? What is this? It's a hadith. It's a that's what the prophet used to do. It's a sunnah. It's just a sunnah. But yes until you pray the prayer. But again, as I'm saying that the problem with applying that for us is that our prayer is very late. The Eid prayer of the sunnah happens right after the sun rises. So I mean you're not going to you're not you're not missing anything anyway. Okay? Because they pray very early. I mean for sun sunrise but that's the sunnah. The sunnah is a prayer is right after the sunrise. So I get there for sunrise like I think today sunrise was like 5:40 or something. So we would pray like at 6 in the morning. The minute the sun rises we would begin the and then we would do the prayer. So for us that sunnah is a little bit difficult because you know if you come to like the third prayer it's at 10:00 in the morning. I mean by the time you're done it's almost lunchtime. So but I I was just answering based on the question. Okay. So somebody or said that people were asking about the the uh the sacrifice this is obviously the of sacrifice and the sacrifice is it's a act of worship to Allah subhana wa ta'ala uh and it is a you know an act of uh sacrificing your wealth because you're buying this animal and you're sacrificing the animal to feed those who are less fortunate. Okay, the the for this is a sunnah. So it's not a it's not an obl obligation but for those who are financially able to it's a sunnah. So the question is does everybody is it a sunnah for every single person or is it a sunnah per family? You know the they have different opinions. Opinion that we follow and that we we we advertise for our community is that it's enough that the that it's done per family. So it's not necessarily an individual sunnah, but it's a sunnah for a family. So each family or multiple families can participate if it's a larger animal and they will sacrifice the animal to donate uh the food. The next set of questions is when you sacrifice the animal does can you take from the animal or do you have to give it all away? The sunnah is that you can keep a third and then you for yourself, a third for your family and then a third you distribute. Can you distribute all of it? You can distribute all of it. Thank you. Can you take it all for yourself? You can take it all for yourself. But then you have left the the benefit and the reward of giving it away. Except in the case if you have made an oath and you swore that you are going to sacrifice for the sake of Allah subhana t. If you do that then it becomes an obligation that you sacrifice and then the entirety of the animal everything its skin and its fur everything its meat has to go to the um to those who are uh in need. So sometimes in the books of people will read uh that the has to all go and to to those who are less fortunate and they don't pay attention to this part that is if you make it an oath. But if we are just fulfilling the sunnah then you can keep a third of it or you can keep a part of it so on and so forth. Can multiple families buy shares into a large animal? That's also permissible that you know if it's like a camel or something very large or a larger cow you can buy shares or you can split the cost of the animal and you can you know sacrifice that way. So whether you outsource the sacrificing or you sacrifice of course here we don't sacrifice ourselves because it's illegal you have to go to a farm and do that both ways will fulfill the sunnah. There are also those hadith about the person who is going to make the sacrifice not to cut their nails and to shave their hair beard or if they're man so on and so forth. This is a sunnah to put yourself in the kind of mindset that you are also in the Hajj because when you're in Hajj, you can't do that. You can't, you know, clip your nails or cut your hair. But this is just a sunnah. It's not something that's an obligation. So sometimes some people they say, "Oh, the beginning of the has come and we're not allowed to cut our hair." And that's, you know, sometimes there's a mis misunderstanding. Um what else can we say about the about the um the age of the animal right so that in the books of you will see or in the time of the prophetam the animal has to be at least 2 years old. Now the thing about the age why does the animal in the sunnah or in the hadith why is the animal two years of age because at that time that was the age in which the animal would yield enough meat for people to eat. So the the reason behind that is the amount of of meat that the animal can produce in our time uh the animal can produce that type of meat earlier. So for us now the issue is not the age the issue is the amount of meat that the animal will produce. So that's another area that sometimes people are not they're not very clear on or they're not paying attention to the details. the the sunnah or that which fulfills the is that the animal when it's sacrificed will yield enough meat for those to eat it. And because of the the changing of time and place and the the nature of the animals and the the the air that we breathe in the water and all of that that the nature of the animals themselves have changed today. [Music] Um so this is the that we do on the day of Eid all the way up until the last day of the which is the 11 13th of so the day there's the day of the 9th of which for us that don't go to Hajj we fast that day it's a great day of sacrifice and forgiveness and then the following day the 10th of is that's when we pray the and then the 11th the 12th and the 13th. Those are called those are the days of the stoning of the jamat. And then every day from the time of the of the day of until prayer on the 13th of we do the after each prayer because these are all considered the days of Eid. So this is why it's sometimes referred to as the big because this is the day in which there are several days that we go through of celebration and observation. So inshallah Allah subhah accepts from us uh those of us that are sacrificing the animals the the inshallah and it's a sunnah that we should stick to and and to keep going and revive if it's lest it be something that's dying. Are there any questions online? I I have a question. Uh can you elaborate a little bit on the outsourcing? Um a lot of people say if you don't sacri slaughter yourself then you it's less than uh sunnah is to slaughter yourself. Uh if you get somebody else to do it or you do it in a different country what are the the implications? Yeah outsourcing the which is for in our context sometimes the only option fulfills the sunnah. That's what I'm saying. Legally it fulfills the sunnah. You know it's a sunnah to do it yourself. It's also sunnah to ride a camel every day. I mean we don't ride a camel every day. So I mean saying that is not enough. The idea is to sacrifice the money to take the money to to purchase the animal to sacrifice it to fulfill the sunnah and to feed those. So if you outsource it or do it yourself, you're doing the the same thing because if you do it yourself, then you have to skin the animal. That's a whole another pro. Killing the animal is easy. But then the rest of it is very very difficult. You really need to know what you're doing. So, and and it can get very messy. So, you need people to do it. Even people that say they do it themselves, what they what they're really doing is they bring the animal, but they bring somebody who slaughters the animal in front of them. So, they're actually not doing it themselves. So, also that's another because you have to it's a it's a craft. You have to know how to do that. Uh yeah. So, fulfing it fulfills the sunnah inshallah. Sorry. So my question is if you is it all right also if you join with several families to do something or even for example you go to a store and buy a certain amount of meat that's been sacrificed. Is that well buy buying the meat that's sacrificed that's not sacrificing. That's, you know, that's just a a charitable giving which which you're rewarded for it. But that's not what the sunnah we're talking about. But it's very common for larger animals that multiple families, you know, they'll say like the animal this animal has seven shares. So we'll get seven families and each family will pay a seventh, you know, share and they'll sacrif the animal will be sacrificed and and donated. So that that also fulfills the sunnah. Uh what if those seven people have different intentions for the sacrifice? Does the sacrifice count? The sacrifice counts inshallah for each person. Um another issue that sometimes comes up if somebody has a new a newborn and they want to do the so the is the it's the same thing but the is for a newborn. Um, so what happens if around now we have a newborn and we want to do the should we do the or should we do the we do the because the is once in a lifetime whereas inshallah the sunnah of the can happen yearly but you can't join the intention for the and the it's either this or it's either that. Yes. Uh so actually this is very common question I I think you mentioned about it that u in both um husband and my for for example we too we can afford to go for this kurbani is it also only important for him the uh to give to a sacrifice or it's also important for me because I have my own income he has his own income so both of we have to do so we said the the the the have different opinions is Is it an individual sunnah or is it a sunnah for a family? There are two opinions. So the opinion that we follow is that it's enough for a family. So that we bring this in the name of the entire family. Whoever we can contribute. Both of us can contribute. Of course you can. Of course or if I can afford I can do it myself or you can you can do two. You can do three or Yeah. Another question is can you do it for family who are in another country? So you can do it for your family in Pakistan or somewhere you're here but you I mean the idea the ideal thing with all charitable giving in Islam is that it's or the default is that it's gi you do it for your immediate environment but sometimes the question can you do it in another country does it fulfill the it fulfills the sunnah you're going to get rewarded for all of that but we don't want to forget that the default is that yeah I'm going to do it here uh because there are people in the area in our vicinity or in our region or in our state whatever in the that need that need help that need support. Um but can it fulfill the sun? Of course it will fulfill the sun because you've done the actal tik tok. So the salat worked all That's it. No more questions. Alhamdulillah. You ask. I'm here. I mean, last last month there was like 80 questions. I think everyone just kind of they've exhausted all the questions. Well, my question is back to AI. I wonder if um I'm sure the the Quran is online, but things like the Hadith, are all those online? Because AI would be looking at that. So if you're using it in So we had a we had a a test project we uh I was working on last year where we tried to create Islamic AI tool uh and we got some experts and we were looking at it. So I kind of we realized or or I mean I'm not a tech person but the what I realized is to use very like fifth grade language is that basically the AI tool scour the what's out there you know and picks it up uh to answer the question. So we wanted to we wanted to use a test you know what does Islam say about homosexuality because for us that's an easy question there's there's no controversy there's no multiple it's a very straightforward question has very straightforward answers so we were surprised is that when we would ask that prompt to different type of tools we would get different sets of answers so that's when we started realizing okay well what is the material that's out there you know that's that the AI tool is using so it's not simply that the material is out there the material has to be out there and also coded in a certain way or or out there in a certain format for the AI bot to to pick it up and there are these technical terms that at the moment moment escapes me but I remember seeing the log and realizing so the question is the Quran and the sunnah online of course we have you know we have tens of thousands of things online but it doesn't seem to be in a format that that it picks up furthermore more. If you just put Islamic intellectual material online, that's not enough to get the right answer. You have to be able to know how to read it and think and analyze it. Many Muslims themselves, they are before the modern age went astray by reading the wrong things or or or reading something and and misunderstanding what they read. So, it's not simply for us, let me put, you know, all of the the major books of Islamic law online or all of the major collections of fatwa online. That's not enough. or the commentaries of the hadith. There's there is a critical thinking aspect for us that that that you have to be trained in. So very very doubtful that the AI will be able to do that. But what we can do is we can put the right type of materials up there for like the basic like level of questions. So we had we generated about a dozen questions or or or queries that we were trying to test to see how the AI tools would would answer. It's and it's quite it's quite disappointing. And as I said anecdotally, all of the times anyone in my teams have ever used AI, it's it's been, you know, subs, you know, a very inferior product. Whether it be translation, whether it be notetaking, whether it be summary, I have not very been impressed. And I don't think the problem is the AI tool. I think it's the user. I think it's the user who puts in the prompt. That's where the deficiency is. And now I see like with my kids and and and younger kids in school, I mean they, you know, chat GBT is like the standard now. Like when you're going to do homework, it means you have the chat GBT out and you're using that to solve things. And that's very very dangerous because I think I mean I remember when you had to look something up you had to look it up in encyclopedia bratannica or you had to like find actual encyclopia you had to go to the index you had so you had to go through the effort of how to look and that even though it was tedious and now I'm grateful that we have something like Wikipedia but if all you know is something like Wikipedia then you're not going to know really what it means to research and then if now when you all you know is sort of AI chat tools you don't even know the Wikip. So I think you yes for people that know how to do the critical thinking it can be a great timesaver but I I worry I worry yeah half of knowledge asking the right question there is a question from chat chatbt yeah no I don't know I haven't read a thank you and welcome back apologies for my ignorance but if you have a Christian friend who passed away and then oh if you have a Christian friend Christian friend and who passed away and their family has invited us to their funeral proceedings. What is the best way to proceed with thank you? The best way is to go to the funeral uh that you've been invited to and to say something positive to the family and just like you would do in any in any normal situation. uh because the prophet stood for the funeral procession of a Jewish man and when the Sahabah said but he's a Jew he said isn't it isn't it a soul isn't it a person a self so we honor the human being uh because Allah has said in the Quran we have honored the human being so for us it's a human act uh before it's a a religious act so there's nothing wrong with that and it also applies for people that have mixed families families that people have family members that are not Muslim. Same thing. You have to keep your ties in the, you know, while you're alive and also when they pass to, you know, send condolences and things like that. There's nothing wrong with that. As not only is there nothing wrong with that, but that's what we should be doing because we're communities. By the way, a pastor came looking for you, Dean. Was it Dean? Pastor Dean Dan. So you go to the church or the temple or the synagogue or wherever the funeral procession is, that's one thing. But participating in an act of worship that's not an Islamic act of worship, that's something that we don't do. So we go and we show our respect and our humanity and we can say positive things, but you know, I'm not going to make a crucifix on my on my chest or I'm not going to take, you know, the Eucharist. I mean, we wouldn't be allowed to anyway because we're not, you know, we're not confirmed in the church, but you know, those type of thing. we wouldn't we wouldn't do the act of worship. I think Muslims need to understand that there's a difference between observing and participating. So we go there to observe. We go there to show solidarity. We go there to show support. But that doesn't mean that we're going to participate in the actual conduct of kneeling. And if you know there's another they made sujud there's like I remember when I was in my master's program and I went to to all of these um you know Hindu and Buddhist temples you know they would go in and they would you know they would prostrate like you know to the statue of the Bu I can't do that but I can go and I can observe and learn and interact with the people but I'm not going to do that myself just like I wouldn't expect if a non-Muslim came to the mosa they would pray with us you know we give them a nice chair they sit comfortably and they observe. It's the same kind of idea. Observing is one thing but but participating in the act of worship of another religion we are prohibited from doing I asked a question last time about um a dua to say when you're planting or growing things. Oh, still. Yeah, that was me. And and I wrote it down and I said when I and I didn't wondering if you found anything. I'm sorry. That's fine. Oh, my bad. I knew there was something. I was when I left the house today, I knew there was something. The thing is, I still have the paper with me. I've been traveling all over the world with it and I wrote it down and then I forgot. Sorry about that. There is a hadith. Uh there is a dua. Um it's going to be in No's. Let me see if I can find something quickly. I apologize. Well, obviously uh learn all things. See, maybe this is something where Chad GBT could have been uh could be helpful. I found something. Uh yeah. Well, it's in Arabic. So, do you want to want to show se Okay, that's tragic. I just want to see where it's from the source. But yeah, are there any other questions while I try to find something? So, back back to the Christian um can a Christian be buried in a Muslim cemetery? No. With burial, everyone is buried in their own in their own cemetery. I mean, I don't think a Christian would want to be buried in a Muslim cemetery or vice versa. Is there anything online? I'm sorry. Will you will you be here for a day? Okay. I'll I'll get you the answer by Are we be here Thursday for the Thursday program? I will bring it to you Thursday rather than actually I I remember reading it. I just uh Okay, when we conclude, we'll make dua. You guys have any questions? Okay. Uh, also we have a a brother that we're making dua for. uh brother Kaiser who was one of the Sunday school teachers was also sick. So making a dua for him for shifat inshallah Allah give him speedy recovery and healing inshallah and all of those who are sick in the community. May Allahh heal them all and all of those who have passed. May Allah subhanaa tala have mercy on them all and Allah bless us in these in these blessed days of inshallah to forgive us our sins and may these be days of renewal inshallah days of forgiveness we ask Allah subhanaa tala to accept the hajj of the our brothers and sisters who have gone on the pilgrimage may they come go and come back safely we ask Allah subhanana wa ta'ala to protect our families and bless our parents and our children to protect our community to lift us and lift others with us to give us the light of faith in our hearts to make us people of the Quran and people of the Sunnah. May Allahh to guide us to that which is pleasing to him and may we live to honor the memory of our beloved prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam. We ask Allahh to give us knowledge that is useful and to keep us away from all harm in this world in the next
