foreign everyone to the uh ask tariq session we have every month i receive your questions received your questions there are actually not that many uh this week so what i decided to do is i don't think we need to belabor these sessions so i'm going to go through the questions i think maybe one or two of them i would like to expand on a little bit more because sometimes when i receive a question like the paradigm or the philosophy that the question comes from i think it's important to to highlight other than that the questions are pretty straightforward so i'm just going to go until we're done the chat is on i have it on my ipad if people have questions that are uh please type them but i'll get to that after i finish the question so i'll begin in the order that i received for those not performing hajj what is the significance of fasting on the day of arafah how best should we observe the day what is the practice in other countries so the day of arafah is a day of of great great benefit it's a day of tawba it's a day of forgiveness the fast it's a it's a sunnah fast for those that are not participating and by fasting and not being at hajj it's our way of participating in the hajj as it were it's a day in which allah glances upon those who are fasting and says you are forgiven many many many hadith talk about the meritorious acts of fasting it's one of those days of the year that you should definitely fast there are many sunnah fasts throughout the year but there are a few of them that are days that you don't want to miss the day of arafah is one of them the day of is one of them the day of the 15th of shaaban is another one so if fasting is difficult for you other than ramadan i would say please try to do those three and this is a great opportunity it's tremendous reward tremendous forgiveness and it's very festive because when you fast the day of arafah and everyone in your house is fasting and community usually you break fast together and not only that but the next day is aids so you kind of remember what it was like during ramadan to fast on the next day why is the next day i eat is because we are celebrating our forgiveness for our fast on the day of arafah so i encourage everyone the day of arafah of course is the 9th of durham it's the day before right please explain the method of distribution of qurbani the sunna is in thirds that after one slaughters an animal a third uh for your family a thor a third for your family meaning your households are a third for your household a third for your family and close associates and then a third that are is donated uh again this is a sunnah for the chef malik he said that you can divide it any way you want if you want to give all of it to charity if you want to give half of it to charity if you want to sacrifice more than one animal one all of one for charity and one for you and your film all of that is good it's all and it's a sunnah we should participate in it because there are many poor people that only eat meat during the eat this is really a naid for them because it's the only time that they experience that so this is one of the impacts of it if a person performs hydro on behalf of another should that person have performed hajj before can i pay someone to perform hajj on behalf of my late parent yes so you are allowed to perform hydrogen umrah for people that have passed as long as you have done that for yourself first so you do your hajj first you know the hydras that you owe and imam mashef i also said that we also owe one omra so as long as you take care of that then you can go multiple times for your parents or for the deceased etc and it is also permissible to pay somebody to do that that person also the same conditions is that they have they have already performed their fortahaj rather than sacrifice can i have the intention that rather than do benji i will donate the cost of that to a refugee we recently had a request from an aid agency to consider this so this this is the western mind it's either or it's black or white so uh there's nothing wrong with donating money to the aid agency of course but that doesn't take place of the sunnah the sunnah is is the is the is the qurbani for obvious reasons because this is the sun of rasulullah this is the of sacrifice so don't we don't want to get into the habit of thinking of things of black and white either or this is a very western i'm guilty of the same thing as a matter of fact one of whenever i'd ask my my teachers to criticize me they said your only problem is that you're western i said what's that means it's you you everything is binary for you it's either left or right it's either up or down it's either black or white this is in the east it's black and it's brown and it's white and it's right up and down all of that together so when you learn to do like that then you will understand and i struggled personally for many many many years with this because it's so against my nature because i grew up here um so i you know i don't criticize the person questioning but we don't want to get in that habit of thinking either or do the qurbani and donate money some of the money to some money to the aid agency why because the qurbani in itself is a sunni in itself is an act of worship it's called qurbani means you are doing something to establish a close relationship with allah and the end result of the qurbani is to feed people that need to be fed so you also achieve that so i would say do both insha'allah and allah will make it easy for you how should a child how old sorry how old should a child be to qualify to have performed hajj once in their lifetime my child was 10 years old accompanied me for hajj performed hajj can this be considered his obligation to perform hajj accomplished so the prophet sallallahu assalam a man brought a child to the prophet and the word that the man used in the hadith is jail jain as we know in arabic means ignorant but after a child is born and after they are breastfed and you know they start sort of walking and running around in the arabic language they call that age because not as a derogatory term not as a derogatory term but to indicate that this child still doesn't know anything yeah they might say mama baba you know things like that but they don't really understand you know social etiquette uh they don't understand necessarily right from wrong so the reason i mentioned this is that in the hadith the man came to rasulullah and you know put up his child and he says does this jail have hajj that word then therefore indicates that the the child is very young before they have reached the age of puberty and then the prophet saws said yes and you also get the reward so you can go to hajj and take your children with you and they are rewarded for it and you are rewarded for that as well but it does not fulfill the hajj obligation because the child is not of mature age so yes this child has like a an extra hajj extra bonus points they are rewarded for that and you as the parent are rewarded for that but still that child when the child reaches the a reaches the age of puberty they cannot say oh i want to hide when i was a child i don't have to do hajj no they still have to do the hajj as long as they are financially able to and they are able to physically minister as the prophet sallallahu assalam stated when i performed the throwing of the stones of the jammard the pebbles did not go far in fact i think it fell on the head of another person in front of me and this qualifier yes inshaallah because again this is the western mind we're very literal you're not you're not hitting iblis right we're not doing it at least it's not that stone wall uh i know some people they go crazy and they take off their flip-flops and they're going to beat the stone wall and it's not iblis it's symbolic we do this because rasulullah did that he said take from me the hajj rights pray the way you have seen me pray so the way we pray and the way we uh make wudu and the way we do the hajj and the way we do the umrah this is the way rasulullah did it remember the famous story of when he was doing tawaf and he came to the black stone he said he's talking to the stone he said well i swear that you are only a stone and were not that i saw rasulullah kiss you i would not kiss you so why did omar bend and kiss the black stone because he saw rasulullah do it so he did it so the the obligation is you have the pebbles and then you throw it you know allah is not going to uh if you're not like a first-rate pitcher it's not going to penalize you if you hit somebody hopefully the person is not injured challah qualifies sometimes it's very crowded you're really far away so you got to like chuck it okay i think the next question is in relation to hajj is there any other religion in the world where there is a similar event where people gather how does loads i don't know how to pronounce that word in the catholic faith compare bathing in the ganges compare is there anything closer to this in the jewish faith well of course the bathing in the ganges is huge i mean it's a massive event for the hindus and the catholics do have their they do have their um places of pilgrimage in europe the shroud of turin for example loads etc when they go up on their knees on the steps etc there are other places throughout the christian world and with in which catholics gather of course the visit to the vatican uh again not at any specific time but that's you know a point of pilgrimage uh many of the orthodox christians will gather uh in easter time in bethlehem or in the whole the church of the holy sepulchre etc all of these are gathering places but there is no institute quite like the hajj and that's one of the unique features of islam and um this is one of the miracles of islam because the hajj is a logistical impossibility and the fact that we still do it and are still able to do it it's really a miracle in of itself all of these people in this very small area and you know very barren area once a year etc it really truly is is a miracle and this is remember the hajj is the hajj of significance so it has a universal meaning it's not just islamic it's abrahamic as well and we say the word abrahamic we mean you know the father of all religions and the father of the abrahamic faith etc as far as the jewish faith is concerned i am not aware of a massive gathering other than yom kippur of course is their major holiday in which they go to temple they fast for 25 hours and they go to temple et cetera ask for forgiveness so this is the high holiday one of their high holidays but as far as a physical geographic place of pilgrimage i'm not aware of something that is at the magnitude of the hajj is the wailing wall in the jewish face similar to the kaaba first of all we call it we call it the wall of burak and this has been its name for over a thousand years and the wailing wall is something new there is a new name which is of course it's jewish in origin but it's also has a political meaning so when we write these questions this is something i want to point out that we should use the our nomenclature without any derogatory meaning to anybody else but we call this wall has a name in islam it's called the wall of burak why because this is the wall and the hinge in which rasulullah tied the burak to that is still there in the wall on his night over the israel in addition that that wall the heart of buddha and the pavement outside the wall where people congregate all of that is part of the aksa complex which is still under the muslim walk for the entire aksa complex now of course this is what i'm saying people will you know it's contentious but according to international standards that the walk has been we talked about that the when jordan uh entered into peace with israel in the 90s the the jordanians the hashemites because the the king and the royal family of jordan are descendants of rasulullah that the might walk and claim of the complex of which the the pavement has been acknowledged by the israeli side so we just mentioned this as far as we want our we want to revive these terms because this is important anyway is it similar to the kaaba no it's not similar jerusalem is the qibla of the jews so if you're a jew you pray towards the east i mean facing jerusalem and the qibla of all of the ambient was jerusalem including rasulullah until it was changed for satan muhammad ali to mecca from jerusalem so jews faced east when they pray i.e facing jerusalem as a holy city that part of the wall is held by the jews to be the last remnant of the second temple of solomon there's a question later that that asks about david and sulaiman so we'll get to that but that is what they believe is the last remnant of the wall of the holy temple and of course there are different opinions within judaism about can they rebuild the temple are they not allowed to rebuild the temple does the messiah have to come back for them to rebuild the temple etc it's a long story but it's not it's not a focal point of prayer as much as jerusalem itself as a city is the public what is the significance of adam's footprint where is it found there's adam's peak in sri lanka is this real there is no certainty of any relic that belongs to any prophet except the relics of rasulallah and this is one of the miracles of satan muhammad no one disputes where the prophet is buried no historian no non-muslim nobody there's been no everyone understands historically that this place in medina in the mosque under the green dome is green green and dome is where rasulullah sallam is buried all of the other mba we don't know with certainty there are graves for moses and aaron and dawud and sulaiman and nuance all of them even in jeddah there's a grave for howe for eve in the old city in the old graveyard so on and so forth but we don't know with certainty so that's number one number two what is this what is it real inshallah why not i mean there has to be some adam was a real person there has to be some place where he came and he stepped and this and that so if i went to sri lanka i would go and pay homage to the footprint attributed to say the hadamard and there's nothing wrong with that but do we know uncertainty we don't know what is its significance is these are from allah's signs these relics are from allah's signs allah told we will keep you or part of you as an ayah as a as a as a sign as a in the mu they have different opinions about whether it's really his body like mummified or whether it's like a shield that's not the issue but even allah uses the example of the disbeliever [Music] we will we will preserve your body as a sign as a sign of what of all of the stuff that happened was so fraunh himself the physical body or the mummified body of firaoun is a sign why not the foot of satan adam or the grave attribute etc there's nothing wrong with that and it's for us to to reflect and to remember that these stories and the quran these are not myths these are real stories and these are real people that lived one of the sect of islam uses a clay piece on the place of sajdah while praying what is the logistics behind this so so this is the practice of the shia of the the twelve version and the shia the conde one of the conditions of their prayer in the jaffari medha is that you can only make sujud on something that is made from the earth not something that is fabricated that's a condition for us it's a sunnah so we also have this opinion in in the sunni schools but it's a sunnah so if a shia one of our brothers or sisters came to this message for example they would pray on the carpet but they would make sure that there was something that that little clay because it's clay it's made of earth they put it in front of them for them to make sujud on or if they have like a janamaz or a prayer mat sometimes on the prayer mat even though the prayer mat is made of carpet in the place of sajda they have little rows of like clay made from earth or you could easily use like a straw mat or something like that so this is because of their fib their understanding that this is a condition for them whereas for us it's a sunnah women usually don't trim their nails to increase beauty of the hands is it permissible usually henna is applied to bride on the eve of their marriage but we apply it also on the eve of aid question mark that's fine there's no there's nothing wrong with hand nights from the signs of happiness and joy that's permissible as far as the nails are increased the elongating of the nails there's a hadith in which the prophet sallam said that the elongated nail is that that shaytan takes shade under the elongated nail so it's not an issue of haram and it's an issue do we follow the guidance of rasulullah you're left to yourself but don't come in complaining when you have difficulty in your life and your nails are six inches long and stuff like that so it's not from the sunnah of islam it's not it's not from the sunnah and see the way the question is phrased women usually don't trim the nails to increase the beauty that's one opinion because we've been domesticated to think that what do we say in english if somebody doesn't have a beard we say clean shaven which assumes what if you have a beard you're not clean you're dirty it's an expression as a matter of fact it used to be the opposite when salahuddin i remember reading this when i was in in college when salah deen conquered jerusalem and he went inside the mosque and he prayed his raka's of conquest etc he sat down and he started receiving the different delegations his children were frightened by the europeans because the european men didn't have beards they thought something was wrong with them they were they were scared it was like the opposite meaning because everybody had a beard it was even it was normal even in the west but for some reason those crusaders they didn't so what my my point is is that when you structure the question this way then you you're thinking automatically long nails means beautiful so when somebody like me says but there's this hadith and this is not from the sunnis oh he's he's strict or he's mean this is not me this is the guidance of rasulallah so clip the nails would be my advice once you told that music is permissible not once i always say this but when we sing we dance too and we dance among women women amongst women it's fine men amongst men but i don't think we dance when we get together but you know what i mean that's okay inshallah and and movement you know for example the sufis they take the movement of the body to the side and they they they make this a spiritual practice the most obvious of course is the whirling dervishes of rumi but there are other forms of uh of motion and and this has evidence because the sahaba they used to move like this they used to move their heads with after the prayer when they would make vicar they would recite quran so all of these things there's evidence there's something about movement one time uh i was living in this is a personal story i was living in bahrain and uh hakeem archuleta who many people who was a is a very prominent muslim american homeopath for whatever reason i don't know how but he ended up he was coming to bahrain for like a week-long seminar or whatever so uh i wanted to go pay my respects and um i was working on this project and you know bahrain is very hot and i guess i guess i was depressed but i didn't realize it so i went to visit him and when he saw me he's like oh man you look really bad you look really awful i was like oh really i'm so happy to see you like yeah but what's wrong man he's like you know hippies like what's wrong with your mood man and he's like uh let's do this together and he just started moving up and down you know allah allah and he says come on and i didn't want to do it i was like come on man i just wanted to say she's like no you got to do it you got to do it i started moving and i started moving and i really loosened up and after i left him and i went back home and i walked in my wife's like whoa what happened to you i was like what do you mean she's like you're like so like light and energetic and so that stuff is real this is not a joke it's not like we make himself hocus pocus this is real movement is real uh exercise is real it it gets your blood flowing physiologically the change in the body changes you it makes you happy and in our faith we have a a series of tradition of lick and movement and stuff like that i'm not trying to equate that with dancing to music but what i'm trying to say is it's natural you know you hear something you get excited you start moving who was one of the shuffles in the 1800s he said i i can't remember the quote exactly because it's like rhyming in arabic but he said something along the lines if you listen to a beautiful melody or if you see a beautiful tree or a beautiful scene and that does not move you then you're a donkey i mean something's wrong with you if you see beauty or listen to beauty and it doesn't move you to excitement then something is wrong with you as a human being because those sights and those smells and that sound are meant to move you to excite you just like when you listen to the quran or you listen to a beautiful poem it's natural that you're going to want to move this is nothing haram allah made us this way why does allah say in the quran that the recitation of the quran is is healing because it's allah's words and allah the prophet and a beautiful voice and the prophet saw would want certain sahabas to lead the prayer or bill to give the then because he had a beautiful voice because it was it would move the people the worst thing you can have is a man whose voice sucks gives that then it's like you scare people away right you want somebody who has a good voice so all of this is natural so as far as the question can women dance with them and of course you know we're happy people and women take part in a beauty context contest contest i think that's where we would draw the line right i don't i would say absolutely not do not participate in a beauty contest again beauty is of many kinds and whatnot but no we are a people of sets we are a people of veiling not of exposure so we we veil our beauty not necessarily exposing when i get my monthly cycle should i wait until i'm 100 clear before i start fasting and praying because i keep seeing brownish and yellow spots for days and sometimes it completely stops for a whole day i do host and start praying and the next day i see browner spots again what should i do in this case so you do have to wait 100 but remember that the longest period of a monthly cycle for a woman is 15 days so let's say you have your cycle and on day seven or day eight you think you're done and you do hustle and you pray in the morning and then by the evening you have spotting again as long as you're within 15 days then the sharia says that spotting is part of the menses have you done something wrong no because you thought that you thought you were done and you showered and etc so as long as you're within the 15 days it's it's considered a height it's considered menses if this happens one minute beyond the 15 days the sharia says that that blood or that spotting is not the blood of the menses it's the blood of something else the fil says this is called an istahada something else not in heiden it's tahada and therefore you you you make your host and you continue your uh liturgical life so as far as the question is concerned yes the woman should be 100 clear that she's finished and this is natural you know your body is not like a machine you know sometimes these things happen you think you're done you do your host you pray a couple prayers later you're spotting that's fine stop as long as it's within the 15 days my relation passed away in england on the 4th of july i am astonished to learn that he left instructions for his body to be cremated is it okay for a muslim to be cremated no it's haram and and therefore your obligation as the living relative is to disobey that order why because our bodies are not our ownership as muslims we believe that these bodies belong to allah and that's why we will be asked about it and our body will testify on against us or for us we do not own our bodies the idea of this cremation whether it's uh influenced by the dharmic religions or whether it's influenced by whatever it's like cool or it's a fact it doesn't matter this is an obl this is a request that we have we as muslims living have no obligation to act upon because it's haram we don't have the right to do that so therefore we would if the person is muslim he needs to be washed shrouded prayed upon and buried in a muslim cemetery in addition because i received this question privately before but for the sake of the community in addition this person that left these instructions didn't leave these instructions written or like notarized or documented just some something that you went around saying when it comes to now in the realm of fatwa this is now more specific and application when it comes to these like end-of-life proclamations the federal process tends not to take the oral statements of people because we have found that this creates problems in the age that we live in there's nothing stopping us from documenting something from having it notarized from having it drafted by a lawyer i mean many of these things can be done online so if somebody comes to me this is separate from this issue somebody comes to me and say oh my father died and before he died he said to me i want to leave everything to the cat so you have no obligation to listen to that because i said is it documented is it notarized is it is there a cod of caracel to the will no no he just this is something he went around saying we say we don't pay attention to that it has to be documented because now we are in the age of paper and digital things and we can confirm that let's say that this man did that that this man stipulated in a written stamped and sealed document that i'm going to be cremated that's that's his business that someone else would have to do that not we would not be able to do that that would be haram president you want to ask something yeah the donation of organs is a difference of opinion most of the modern fetal bodies allow the giving organs the more conservative opinion which is the opinion i follow is that it's haram but it's a difference of opinion if you ever find yourself in an issue in which there's a difference of opinion you are allowed to follow the opinion that is easy because our deen is rahman the only thing that we can criticize if something is absolutely haram it's absolutely haram to cremate a body it's complete there's no it's haram so that's not a difference of opinion the sisters need to cover their heads when reading or listening to the quran why is it because angels are present it's just a habit of respect it's not obligatory sometimes we read in our classical books things and they get mixed into the modern world as if it's like halal and haram like imam al-ghazali and the likes of imam al-ghazali will say you know from the custom of going into the bathroom is that you cover your head and i've had teachers uh that were like that you know they have like big turbans but when they would go to the bathroom they would take their turban off and they would have like a little topia a little koofi in their pocket they would put it on their head and they'd go into the bathroom this is not halal and haram this is custom why because he was writing the bathroom was probably nasty so you needed to cover your head because it's extra protection from filth or something like that but our bathrooms now even the bathroom in the masjid is more fancy and more luxurious than even the bathroom of like caesar you have to understand that so things change things evolve this is one of those things so no when the woman does not have to wear hijab at home and does not have to wear the cover it's just a women do it out of respect for the foreign as a as a rule other than when you are in the state of geneva for men and for women in which we know that we're not allowed to recite the quran in most circumstances we should never find ourselves in a situation that something has prevented us from reading the quran or something has prevented us from remembering allah because this is how shaitaan plays with you sometimes the photographs discourage angels presence some persons follow sufi tradition have a picture of the sheikh and look at it before they leave home daily is this okay also they go to a ziyarah of the sufi and hug the cement structure covering it it is permissible photographs are not haram what the prophet saw said was the surah surah in the arabic language means a three-dimensional image in modern arabic when photography came the modern photograph was mistranslated into modern arabic asura if you ask any arab in our mosque like what do you call the photos on your the app on your phone you say sur photos but that's not what the word surah means in arabic and that's the problem why many people think the surah the photographs is haram i don't know i mean i'm not a linguist i don't know what the right word should have been but the surah of rasulullah is obviously not the iphone photo because that didn't exist at his time so what did the surah of rasulullah mean a three-dimensional statue that was made for the purpose of worship or exalted status why did i say that because there's a hadith in which the prophet saws walked into the room and said aisha was playing with something and then she hid it behind like a curtain he said what's that and she pulled out a horse with wings i said what's this she's like oh these are like the horses and the wings of satan and the prophet saw some laughed so hard that you could see his wisdom teeth it's one of the few hadith in which laughed very loudly obviously that's a sign of approval not a sign of this is haram wasn't the the winged horse that she was playing with wasn't it a three-dimensional image or structure yes but it was not done with the purpose of exalting or it was not like a letter and she's making she's playing with it so the surah that the prophet saw is talking about is for example we want to honor one of our trustees so we decide we're going to make a bust of our trustee and we're going to put it here you can't do that it's not the place for that that's the surah that will not allow the angels or prevent the angels from coming which is why when you go to any mosque or any muslim home you know it's you find the ayat of the quran or the description of rasulullah or the picture of the kaaba or something like that who was the grand mufti of egypt in the 1920s he actually wrote a book and joab the complete answer into the permissibility of photographic images to explain that photography i mean at his time in the 1920s was simply the shutter opening and capturing light the light being captured and making the likeness of this image that's not haram okay so the notion that photographs or haram demonstrates that the person saying that does not understand the hadith in the context of rasulullah and there are many people that are very respectable that are greater bigger than i will ever be that actually say that pictures are haram unfortunately on this they are completely wrong for the reasons that i've mentioned okay so that's one part of the question the other part of the question sufi people have a picture of the sheikh and they look at it before they leave the home again it's like you have a picture of your parents or a picture of your children or a picture of your spouse or a picture of your car whatever motivates you you know for people it's their sheikh so the the uh it's all permissible because they're all photographs why do they do this because it reminds them you know it reminds them of what's true or reminds them of what's honest it reminds them of their obligation towards allah subhana tala etc there's nothing wrong with that then they uh hug the cement structure this is not from the sunnah of the of the prophet aya so when we go to visit the graves the sunnah is not to go crazy and jump on the grave and hug it that's not what we do we stand there with respect as if this person is in front of you because this person is in front of you because allah reminded us that the people are alive in their graves they hear us they just can't respond to us so if you go to visit rasulullah he's there so if rasulullah was in front of you would you jump on top of him and go crazy you would be so overcome with all you would stand there with respect so the sunnah is that when you go to these places you stand with respect now there are some people who get carried away and because of the love and the emotion and that's fine if it comes from an honest place but it's not optimal that's not the way of the senate and i've never seen any of my teachers ever do that they always are composed i have seen people go crazy but every time i go to the ziyarah of some like signal hussein in egypt like a common one it tends to be the same people that go crazy so that also makes me question whether allah knows best but that's not from the sunnah of the prophet isam or the senate what exactly does prayer is on the prophet says in the quran why because there is no created person or created entity or anything in the created universe that is greater than rasulallah you have to understand this is a cardinal this is what rasulullah means we called rasulullah the the big pillar or rock upon which is leaning the whole world that's how he is rasulullah you can sit and praise and contemplate how amazing rasulullah is it won't do him justice so because of this immenseness and this awesomeness and his mercy and all of the things that we've been talking about in all of our classes dedicated to rasulullah has elevated him to the status that his name is recited with each then his name is recited in each prayer think about the time zones every time zone there is an adhan there's a mosque somewhere somewhere in the world that's saying allah says to be known so this is a miracle of the quran the muslims like other faith traditions could have forgotten about the prophet and not mentioned him often but look how often we mention rasulullah's name so this is a miracle and the salah on the prophet sallam all your problems that's the key a man came to rasulullah i mentioned this to you before and he said ya rasulullah i'm gonna one third of my free time i'm gonna spend doing salawat on you is this good the prophet saws said good and if you do more it would be better he said okay half i'll give you half of all of my extra time and i'll do salawat on you is this good the prophet saws this is good and if you do more it will be better and he kept going so he said all of my extra time ya rasulullah every moment spare i have i will do salawat on you is this good the prophet saw salaam said this is good way and it's enough for you so because of this hadith and many others the saying salawat on the prophet saw solves your needs which is why it's very common when you lose something what do you say or you forget something what was i what does salat on the nebby have to do with i forgot because it's it's like a it's like an instinct and then you do it and then you remember because your needs are solved by rasulullah so those are like the mundane things i can't find my keys or i can't find my phone imagine you know what that will do for you that will come and it will liberate you from all of that stuff that we hear about in the quran and the sunnah about the hash and the nation and the suan and all of you got a fast straight ticket you'll find yourself in front of rasulullah drinking from his hands khalas it's over all of this because you did salat on the prophet i saw salaam the prophet said whoever the closest to you to me are those of you that make salah on me frequently you are with the one whom you love even just love of the prophet solves that problem so yeah we can go on and on suggestions on a subject matter angels in islam well we we selected i selected the gazelle [Music] it's one of the last books that he wrote in his life it will occupy us for at least two years it's a great book it's a book book it's not like a bullet points it's like a book book so it will take us it will that's islam a to z we'll talk about angels along the way what is islam's position on abortion is it permissible at any point if so at what point is it they say that the first 120 days the first four months because of the hadith that the rua has not been placed into the body abortion is possible without preconditions of course i say that i mean it's permissible but it's also a big uh choice i mean i'm not advocating for that but it's permissible after that point it would require a fatwa from a mufti depending on is you know the mother had harmed what does the doctor say it says you know case by case but there are just the shadia is very liberal when it comes to these we don't have this you know evangelical christian problem at all i mean it's such not a problem that muslims i don't know i'm surprised that they keep asking about it of course if you know the mother's in harm's way or if the doctor says the baby is you know uh severely uh under the whatever the case may be the sh she has very liberal when it comes to these cases but it's two beyond the 120 days it would require an actual case-by-case basis can i pray sunnah prayers on behalf of the deceased who have made misprayers no this is the one thing that we can't do for the deceased because allah says [Music] that prayer has been given to each one of us as a specific allotted thing so even though we can do hajj and umrah and fast and settle deaths and do sadaqah etc we can't do the prayer for the deceased in school we are asked what is the difference between sunni and shia ismail what is the simplest explanation it's like asking me what in one sentence what's the difference between democracy and marxism it's a big big thing the simplest [Music] explanation we have an important we have a special mushaf in our family and we are three brothers one brother is called sunni one brother is called shia the third brother is called ismail and we're arguing where should we place should we place it on this table should we place it on the bookshelf should we place it in the drawer this is the difference between the sunni the shia and this we're all brothers and sisters of the same family we all say the shahedah we all face the qibla we all eat halal food we honor the quran and the sunnah but there are differences that stem from certain issues regarding after that after those basic agreements those there are certain differences of course we say emerge from the political circumstance that happened after the passing of rasulullah the shia will argue that it's not about politics but it's about the right of the family of rasulullah whom we honor and love to rule politically as well as spiritually that's really the difference the result is that the sunnis are a majority about maybe 85 80 85 and the shia of all of their denominations are a minority but from the arabian peninsula east even though the global numbers are as i said it's sometimes it's 50 50. or sometimes there are places like iraq or kuwait or bahrain even afghanistan and the subcontinent in which the shia might even be more than the sun so it's important that we understand these things now despite what i say there will always be political differences i'm not naive i understand that but what we need to raise our children to understand is that we are one family because this fitness between the sunnis and the shia is can be easily exploited by other people who wish us harm and wish us to fight amongst one another rather than to be united the shia are considered a madhhab of a manhattan of theology that we acknowledge as as muslim and they have done the same for allah this is the reconciliation that has been happening between sunnis and shias since the 1950s this is what we were taught this is how we deal with the xi'an we when we greet them you know they're our brothers and sisters so on and so forth the differences go back to the early generation if we want to know the differences you know who will be the imam or the khalifa etc but remember this example of the three brothers you know from the same family okay somebody sent uh uh well we are okay there's still four more questions did moses pass away before seeing palestine yes and after he was passed away he was carried his body was carried across into into palestine and that's why there's a grave attributed to him there the jews lived in that area for some 73 years under david and solomon any more details okay so i wrote down the timeline so saul who i gave the khudbab a couple weeks ago his son-in-law was sitting in the was in his army and sidney dawood became the king of the jews and then after him so the men established the first temple approximately in 957 bc now of course when you go from bc to zero you count down from 957 or from the time of saul until 722 the hebrews ruled in the palestine area until the assyrians conquered israel and then judah judea fell in 587 bc to the babylonians what the jews call the babylonian exile the temple was destroyed during the babylonian the first temple was destroyed during the babylonian occupation of palestine and jerusalem in 587 so in that little chunk from saul to the babylonian destruction of the temple that's about 400 years of hebrew rule in that area under the persians the jews were allowed to return but they were not allowed to rule the temple was rebuilt a second time and allah mentions this in the quran and the temple was finally the second temple was finally destroyed in 70 ce by the roman emperor titus and then the jews were expelled and remained a minority up until the modern state of israel if you take from the time of the original arabs that inhabited palestine till today the hebrews slashed the jews only ruled politically for 10 of the time of the history of that land so i that's i don't know what the question wanted exactly but i just wanted i wrote down the timeline okay a child has not seen their parent for 10 years uh and this was a personal question that was sent but the upshot is that there's a child an adult child that has not seen their parent for 10 years and the parent is elderly now you have to understand that your spiritual livelihood depends on partly a larger part on the way you treat your parents now say my parents are abusive to me i still have obligations because they're my parents that's what we have to remember just because my parent might be a bad person or even a non-muslim or a disbeliever or someone that's that hates islam for example whether they were a sahabah their family and their parents didn't become muslim you still have an obligation towards towards them this is a that's why allah reminds us in the quran because if allah left it to us we would just sort of you know what the hell i don't care they're bad we're not allowed to do that you have to find some way of doing good in this case the family is muslim it doesn't matter what the parent did you know your father or your mother their elderly they're about to pass don't let them pass when they're upset with you going to them and making them smile that smile might enter you into jannah despite what you think they've done to or despite what they've actually done to you or whatever the abuse just seeing your parent bringing happiness on your parents face that act you have no idea the weight of that action allah you can give all you want you can pray all you want you can fast all you want but that act alone it's so great you will not even comprehend it until you face allah meet allah so the our obedience to our parents is something that is sacred the prophet sasalam said that keeping your family ties keeping ties with your parents it elongates your life you can either elongate your life literally or it can be long late elongate your life in the sense that you get more risk or what or you have more barakah don't forget that again we're not two dimensional people there's a huge dimension called baraka baraka is very important don't don't underestimate the barakah don't don't underestimate uh look one time there was a man my sheikh sheikh and he walked into the hussein mosque and the hussein mosque is very it's very big and when you walk in the mosque you know like our mosque is this way and the other door is way way just like you know it feels like it's like an acre away so he walked into the mosque and he saw this man who looked very you know beautiful and saintly and the sheikh who's narrating the story he said i said to myself i'm going to go kiss this man's hand because he sensed that there was something about this man and that man because he was actual saint he felt that this young sheikh was going to come and kiss his hand so the minute he saw him approaching he went like this like that because he to make him like toward him you know there are people like that i don't want any attention so the sheikh was narrating the story he said even if i'm gonna kiss this man to him and he kissed this man's hand and since that day the sheikh swore and all of his students you know he passed away many years decades ago he said he never got a cold for the rest of his life so don't underestimate the baraka and where you find it making your parents happy as they get older that they get lonely maybe they have regrets if you feel you've been abused or wronged whatever this is for you be selfish go for yourself for the barakah you have don't don't be so shallow and too dimensional my parents you know bad to me i don't want anything to do with them don't be like that you have to show rahman that act of mercy might save them might make them turn like the mgtow so on and so forth do this while you have the chance before your parents pass because when your parents pass of course you can still show obedience to them but it's going to be different do this while you have the chance do not underestimate the power of the dua of your parents and your parents can make you or break you in in arabic in egypt especially we have this like theme or maybe it's like an azhar thing i don't know but like when you see this somebody who's messed up you say who knows maybe his mom made dua against him it's like you're so messed up that the only way you can be this dysfunctional is if your mom may dua against where does this expression or this theme come from because we know that the parents dua is accepted so do you want your mom especially your mom to make dua against you no so before the exam what are you doing mama please make dua from i have an exam at 10 15 a.m i need you to stop everything you're doing at 10 15 and read surat yasir why do we do that because you know mama's dua is accepted um even for your kids mom my kid is sick but please make dua why do you ask your mom for the life because you know there's no there's no gap between that and the dua so this dua that's powerful for the father as well don't underestimate that so don't don't cut off your ties you're hurting yourself you're harming yourself okay questions that came in oh no i lost them i'm trying to explain to th this to my kids but don't know that i really understand why the qibla is northeast and southeast i went online that's the first mistake never go online that's why you have me also they are and i look i even wear a red hat so you can see you can find me in the crowd also they are saying the world is around so does it really matter does it matter if the world is wrong this is a hakita the world is around this is the whole issue that the world is around it does to me but what is the scholarly theologian view this is not about scholarship this is about geography this is about reality the world is round please we've dealt with this centuries ago that we are taught the world that the world is around the world is not flat news flash the world is round and because the world is around if you put a string on washington dc take your shoelace and put the shoelace on washington dc and then you make it very tight and you stretch it as much as you can and you put it in mecca you will see that the string going out of washington dc is northeast because it's a circle and because it's a circle the shortest if i'm washington dc is here mecca is here the shortest distance is this way haven't you noticed that when the plane takes off and you go for africa or even near europe you're going this way now if you think that the qibla is south east tell the captain on the next flight i'm going to please go south and see where you will end up you'll end up in antarctica or south africa or something like that i guarantee you allah and all of these people have already established this the ichimo by consensus the qibla in north america is northeast we have a globe next time i'll bring my shoelace or a string and i can show you physically i can demonstrate if you don't believe me and this is you like i thought it was just joking there is an american keller he wrote an entire book like 3 400 page book just on this issue demonstrating it and he did a demonstration that's even more impressive which is the hat agree that the space above the kaaba is also the cabin so for example if you wanted to extend the cab like 500 feet up you could i mean no one's going to do that but you could and there's one time in the year when it's mecca you can see the sunrise in north america and if you do that i can't remember what day it is but if you do that and you had somebody in mecca for and the event is happening and they call the person in north america and they say where do you see the sun because the sun is right now above the cabin they will say we see it in the northeast so that means you physically are seeing the kaaba physically this is not like the string and it's physical by consensus of the anyone who thinks anyone who knows even the consensus of nasa we agree with them it's northeast okay i thought souls traveled so are they at their graves all the time most of the time did i miss here please clarify thank you yeah the souls are tethered in a way to the body so they can travel but they're tethered so when you go to the grave of so and so there they are there because that's physically where they are they were buried how can we encourage our teens to pray teens i don't think you can encourage them when they're young you need to teach them to pray prayer comes by observation by habit if a child grows up seeing their parents pray they'll pray or they won't think it's weird if a child grows up seeing their parents or father for example who only prays when they go to the mosque they'll do the same thing or if they see that the parents pray quickly at home but pray slowly at the mosque so so on and so forth so these things when i get a question that has teens in it we need to start when they're younger as far as teammate we just talked about the parent's diet for their child et cetera it's accepted make god for the for your children uh explain to them the importance of this you can teach them that they can combine the host in either time either time that way the prayer will be easier for them so they only have to pray the five prayers and three times during the day for example you can you know try to come to the mosque more often pray as a family at home pray madrid together at home so on so these are the things that you can do to encourage it inshaallah but with all things you need to come with love and and mercy and not with fire and brimstone because this is the sunnah of the prophet but at some point you do need to explain to them the consequences of not praying especially if they're older those are all the questions anything else define the word how do i define what a place to a place to rest we also use for bed a place to rest [Music] three minutes that's what ibn hassam says ibn hasan is one of the great jurists and this is the opinion we usually we give people in order not to prevent people from having a relationship well sorry you don't need to do to read to recite a quran from memory the issue is do you need to have to touch the muslim even says you don't and this is the opinion that we go with because it's what happens is when people say oh i can't touch the quran because i don't have what ends up happening is they don't make wudu and therefore they don't read the quran and then they lost that opportunity so to break that we say no don't follow that opinion freely it's a little bit different what we should do is we should show them the quran that's translated because that's technically not the quran because more than 50 percent of it is not the quran if if it's a quran quran like arabic only from faith that's a problem because we know that you know they're not in a state of purity uh so another way around that is you can show them like the jews you know the quran are like in 30 parts you can show them apart because that part is not the quran either or if we had like a a special illuminated like poster of one of the nice pages of the obviously they could look at that so there are ways around it but if it happens by accident not considered a muslim so if the if the quran has arabic and then has tafsir or arabic and then the english and then footnotes as that means that more than 50 percent of the of of the text is not the arabic so therefore it's no longer considered the quran the quran in islamic law is specifically defined as one volume from the fatah tunas written in the authentic script so if it was written in another script it wouldn't be considered no if it's one page it's not the most so like if you had a ring or a necklace that had eight of course you wouldn't have to remove that if you went to the bathroom or something because that's not considered quran i mean it's part of the quran of course but it's not the it's not the most half that the hadith talk about or the quran how do you talk about not touching it if you don't have so on and so forth like if you had cds or tapes that's not the most half that's talked about in the text you can listen to the quran even if you have if you're in a state of major ritual impurity if a woman has a if you're in a state of geneva you can listen to the quran of course and there's a difference of course if the quran is playing in the background or if you're actively listening there's a difference of things no don't think of it as disrespect and respect think of it as that's how powerful the quran is that any aspect of the quran has benefit even looking at the quran has benefited and that's why it used to be in muslim majority places and it's still like that for many places is that you know any shopkeeper when they start their day they would play the quran or any cab driver when they start their day they would you know play their quran for like at least like the first half an hour it's just normal even while they're working that's how powerful the quran is so we wouldn't say oh that's disrespectful we'll say that's like you got 10 of the quran and then the young boy that's in the young girl in the mosque memorizing the quran they're like getting like sixty percent and the person who's a hafiz and reciting he's like 80 look at it like that again not black and white you know disrespect is like you know you step on the quran stuff allah you chucked it across that's disrespectful but i want to listen to the quran or i want it in the background it's all barakah and there are many people who have memorized the quran just that way they just all they have they constantly hear it and you will find if you listen to the quran all the time you will find that there are verses that you have picked up like when ramadan comes and then the imam is leading taraweeh oh i know that first oh i know that page oh i remember where did you learn it because you just you just heard it so as a rule as i said never find yourself in a situation where you've prevented yourself from a relationship you
