okay so we're going to do things a little bit differently tonight inshallah I'm going to I have some prepared remarks maybe uh 15 minutes or so I think it will be helpful to provide some background and then we have the the questions uh that me and imami will go through I think a lot of the questions will be answered kind of implicitly in what I'm going to say but I wanted to provide um what I think are some important background points this is not uh necessarily A History lesson or a survey of history but rather just main points that you need to know about and if you want to know more about this issue you're going to need to do more research of course much of what I'm going to say will be contended uh will be contentious you know by by by the antagonists so I mean that I also admit it's not like everything I mean obviously I'm presenting what I believe to be sound history based on facts but when we get into the more uh I'll highlight certain issues they will be uh you know people will argue against them so the first issue I want to mention that is very very important for you to understand the nature of the current conflict is you have to understand that ever since the time of Christ there has been a systematic Christian Western Christian persecution against the Jews and for nearly 2,000 years the Jews in Europe have lived in you know absolute horrible conditions and standards they were ghettoized they were forced to wear certain clothing banned from wearing certain clothing they were not allowed to hold certain jobs they were not allowed to marry without permission a lot of times they were extra they were taxed they were not allowed to hold certain jobs sometimes their places of worship were closed and ransacked I mean absolute horror you know horrible situation systematically that's very very important for you to understand and to acknowledge it's so bad that many Jews in Europe that were able to left who were able to and lived under Muslim Ru so that's why for centuries there were a flourishing Jewish community in Spain and then after the collapse of Islamic Spain and the in 1492 some of them were absorbed into North Africa but some of them also fled into the Ottoman Empire so throughout the history of the Ottoman Empire there's also been a flourishing Jewish population and of course there are Jewish populations throughout the Muslim World in Egypt and Yemen you know so on and so forth I mean even from the time of the Prophet till our time there are still Jews that live within the heartland of the Muslim world and the Muslim uh the Jews that lived under Islam had the complete opposite experience so in a way and this obviously will be contentious but Islam saved Judaism because Islam was able to keep Jews intact free to worship they also were able to save the Hebrew language and Hebrew grammar came from the influence of the Arabic garans there was a time there was a point in time when Jewish uh intellectual leaders uh amongst the Jews in Spain would write in Hebrew but using Arabic letters so not only did Islam save Judaism but the AR more specifically the Arabic language carried the Hebrew language through this great persecution that was happening to the Jews and that's also important to note that there is no essential problem between Islam and Judaism there is no essential problem between Islam and any religion we are the religion of coexistence and that's inshallah what I'll I'll dedicate Friday's to insh Allah talk about about that and we have no problem because our system of coexistence puts the burden on those communities okay you adjudicate your cases and your lives and you run your lives with your religious law you do it yourself save us the trouble you do it yourself so it puts the the burden on them so they have to write articulate form uh legal counsels uh build their places of worship so on and so forth whereas in in Europe under in the name of Christianity I mean even some of the early Crusades that went out on the way to the holy land they would persecute Jewish populations in Europe so this was and they also persecuted other Christians that they didn't like but that's another story but I want you to understand this this is a important the first thing I want you to understand the second thing I want you to understand is that because of this persecution and because of the changing tides in Europe at in the middle and the end of the 18th century there was a you know what we refer to as the Age of Enlightenment a different type of thinking and that different type of thinking also impacted the Jews of the time so in the middle of the 18th century between like you know let's say 1750 to 800 1800 just to make it simple there was a strong movement of Jews in Europe to start thinking about assimilating whereas before they were ghettoized and as before you know they looked different they dressed differently completely they were you know they were completely other I mean if you if you went and you saw those cities they obviously are different they're not like the rest of people but now they started to think well let's assimilate let's become German Jews let's become Dutch Jews you know so on and so forth and one of the main things that happened during the this time was uh was a great you know sort of Jewish um Enlightenment thinker Moses Mendelson who died in 1786 who translated the Torah into German so this was also in line with the way of thinking of modern or a the enlightenment type of thinking that happened in Europe at this time period all of this becomes the seeds for what becomes the reformed Jewish movement and this is the second major thing you need to understand to make sense of what's happening today the reformed Jewish movement started to offer a different type of interpretation of the Torah of the talmud it was not as literal as what we refer to academically as Rabin Judaism today maybe we call them Orthodox but at the time I mean the way I was taught it was just Rabin Judaism so the reform movement started to say well you know everything doesn't have to be exactly the the way that's that's listed in the text a lot of the text can be allegorical a lot of the text can be suggestive it doesn't have to be so strict and they actually formalized this in the reformed uh Judaism or reformed Jewish Constitution uh in a conference that took place of all places in Pittsburgh in 1885 so throughout the 1800s this emergence of the reform movement offered a different type of interpretation to the religion and then you you'll come to see very very slow very quickly why this is important I know that people that talk about what's happening in GZA now are not going to mention this kind of background but this is the way I think I'm always looking at what are the first principles what's the what's the heart of this issue because if we understand the heart of the issue inshallah we'll be able to talk about the rest of the things as I said when I addressed this a couple of Fridays ago most people that are talking about this that advocate for the Palestinian cause you know our cause it's all we're all together alhamdulillah they don't necessarily know these things and therefore I think they end up saying things that they shouldn't say and articulating things that they shouldn't articulate okay uh so Abraham G Gyer Gyer I don't know how to pronounce his name exactly he died in 1874 he was one of the major rabbis to form this Reform movement so it is because of the persecution of the Jews in Europe notice how the Jews in what end up becoming what we call ashkanazi Jews and then there are the sapharic or the Mahi Jews which are the Jews that come from Spain or grow up in Arab lands so the Jews of Europe they are the ones that start thinking about this new way of thinking and it is through this interpretive you know this change in interpretation which will be linked with the next step the next the Third ma major thing I want you to learn which is the rise of nationalism now of course after the uh after Napoleon and the French Revolution there was the sense that okay we can have our own State people are free we don't have to follow these Antiquated feudal systems medieval systems we want National so there was this rise of nationalism that happened in Europe and then also the Jews in Russia who also were equally persecuted and pograms and all of these horrible things I mean this is true these were horrible things that you know that's what happens when when people are inhumane and don't know how to coexist uh and there was this concept of Mother Russia right so the same thing happened in Russia that also happened in Europe this idea of nationalism this idea that we can be our own we can have our own state it was at this time in the late 1800s that the Zionist movement emerged sort of with all of these Trends happening at the same time so I'm giving you this introduction to say this which is that when Theodore Herzel who was a vienes secular Jew uh he died in 19 he was born 1860 to 1904 often he was an Austrian Jew he was an Austrian Jew a Jew by birth but he wasn't like he was a journalist he was he wasn't practicing or anything like that he sort of put all of these things together well we've been persecuted in Europe we've been trying to assimilate and the assimilation is not really happening because you know up until that time the the Christian majority aspect of Europe did not really welcome these people did not want these people and by the way I forgot to mention because they were persecuted and they were not allowed to have many jobs this is what formed forced the Jews historically into money lending and other type of financial services what we call now Financial Services because the Christians were like oh in in our language they say this is Haram stuff you guys do it oh and they did it and then they became wealthy so not only were they persecuted but then they were being envied because they were the ones lending money to you know and some of the lending houses became very wealthy and very influential like the Rothchild house house that had different Financial houses in different European countries and it it made the persecution even worse even though they were like taking money from them but then persecuting him at the same time so somebody like Theodore Herzel he's like well why don't we as Jews have our own Homeland and this was the beginning of the Zionist movement okay we've been persecuted uh we're not assimilating uh and you know what because of the reform movement by this time it's it's been you know 60 70 80 years of of thought process we don't have to be so strict as JW Judaism is not about following the law it's not about following the the Torah to the letter it's not about following the talmud it's not about following the way that the we don't have to keep kosher you don't have to have a koser kitchen and you can't work on the Sabbath it's it's more about identity and that's why why that that that bid of the reform movement is very significant for you to understand what ends up happening with the Zionist movement which is allowed them to move away from you know what we would look at as a proper Orthodox interpretation of their texts to start to argue we need to come come together because now nationalism is is the Rave and we have to have our own Jewish homeland our own place to live now the reason I mentioned this is that the traditional interpretation from Orthodox Judaism or Rabin Judaism is that Jews are forbidden from coming together to have their own Homeland because they sinned and this is a punishment and then you know when the Messiah comes he'll bring everyone together and then they can go this is known as the three Oaths which is an interpretation of a of a passage in the talmud now if any of our Jewish neighbors heard me now they would be very offended by what I'm saying and they'd say no this is completely incorrect most like and these people are nut jobs which is part of the reason why we need to say it because well maybe now they're they're looked at as nut jobs you know all of these rabbis that you see that are against Israel and they wear the Palestinian cafea and and they said there's a separation between Zionism and Judaism well that's actually what we're trying to say is okay they might be a minority but that's actually historically intellectually accurate that for 2,000 years or whatever however long a long period of time the Jewish establishment understood that they were not meant to come together to form a national Homeland and then all of a sudden with this nationalistic Zionist movement they redid the argument and that is linked together with this idea that well we don't have to be so strict in how we interpret things so obviously that one one of these one and two led to three so Theodore Herzel started this movement and started to gra Garner attention amongst European Jews that were just like him completely secularized you know fed up with this assimilation nonsense wanting to you seeing the Rave of all you know all of these persecuted Jews in Russia and they're just persecuted ghettoized everywhere Let's us have our own place so he hosted uh I think it was called the world Zionist conference in basil Switzerland I think they had two of them and the argument was like we're going to select a country so it was either Argentina Uganda or Palestine I don't know why I I didn't I mean that I'm not really interested in knowing why but before Herzel died in 1904 it was Uganda actually when I went to Uganda they call Uganda the pearl of Africa well that's what the Ugandan say I don't know if that's what people everyone says but the Ugandan say that Uganda is the pearl of Africa it's a beautiful country masallah and obviously Palestine was there for the sort of sentimental reason that you know Jerusalem and whatnot I mean obviously there's a reason but it wasn't the focus the focus was we just want our own we want our own place now with the rise of Zionism there are a couple of things that happened in in the early 1900s that you also need to know about there was this very unfortunate situation in France called The dfus Affair where there was this French uh captain or something or other in the Army who was Jewish dfus and he was being attacked his loyalty to the state was being attacked and it was this I mean it's a now you look back it's a simple thing but it was super scandalous it was super scandalous and Friends it was super scandalous all over and actually Marcel PR who you know I love the the novelist who was Jewish himself the French novelist half of his book The Seven novel book is talking about he uses the drus affair as a back as a backdrop and it became sort of a litmus test at that time either you are a a progressive person or not a progressive person so if you're Progressive you accept the Jews as French French Catholic French Jew who cares you're French and then the less Progressive people that have that hidden racism that we see now all all displayed Mah in full color that they're against drist and questioning his loyalty because how can you be loyyal to the French State when you're Jewish you know so which is funny because that's exactly against the French con concept of democracy that they that Napoleon was supposed to have brought and liberated the world with so I don't know how that happened but it happened so that was a huge Scandal and it was inescapable if you were in Europe at that time the 20s and 30s added to that was uh Herzel tried to purchase Palestine from Sultan ABD II because at the time the holy land was under the city of the Ottoman Empire was part of the Ottoman Empire now what happens is in the World War I the ottomans are defeated so in World War I the ottomans are defeated and the British take control of Palestine that's what we refer to as British mandate Palestine so from 19617 let's say until 19 19 4748 the founding of the state of Israel the British are in control of Palestine now Herzel has since died he died in 1904 the people after him ha wisman and others that took over the Zionist movement they're starting to Lobby the British and this is when the famous balfor Declaration was issued the Bal balfor declaration sounds so Grand but it's a piece of paper that has one sentence on it but it is called the Bal for declaration that was issued on November the 2nd 197 17 that lord balfor said that his Majesty's government looks favorably on the establishing of a Jewish Jewish homeland in Palestine now when the British took over Palestine you have to understand that they took over immediately the ottoman bureaucracy and infrastructure that was in place because for like the last four 500 years the Ottomans were governing uh Palestine uh you know Jerusalem haa so on and so forth and one of the myths that you need to be careful of is that there's an argument that will say that these were there was nobody living here that the Palestinians were nomadic that they were bins that they were backward you know they used to eat their dung and drink their Ur and all that kind of stuff and the Jews came or the Zionist I should be more accurate came and they created cities out of sand dunes this is this is historically a complete fabrication because the the the Ottomans governed this place first of all it's Jerusalem so Jerusalem had sh courts had a they had schools so on and so forth um so when the British took over they took control of the Deeds the land Deeds that all of these people had so yeah it was agrarian but the whole world was agrarian at this time or or maybe the Middle East and the Muslim world or Arab world was still more agrarian and the industrial revolutions you know hasn't swept completely the way it did in Europe so they were still agrarian but a lot of these land owners were people that didn't necessarily weren't there all the the time some of them lived in Damascus some of them lived in Tripoli Beirut some of them lived in Istanbul some of them lived in Cairo so on and so forth so when the British government took this over they they they they basically in a very you know you know damn them in a very dubious you know way the way that you would expect of the British Colonials they started giving these Deeds to these zionists that were immigrating from the mid 1880s and that's how now another myth that you'll hear is that well the Palestinians sold the land yeah there were some Palestinians that sold land to the Zionist but maybe it's like 3 to 4% of the land but the vast majority of it was not sold in that way it was usurped in one way or another somebody um didn't pay their back taxes and the deed automatically went to the uh ottoman municipality so when the British come they like oh look this guy forfeited his taxes so we get to take it you know but this guy this guy has been living on this land for 22 Generations he has the deed of the original land and he's selling the land I mean he he is not aware that he is he has to play pay back taxes that's not how the ottoman system worked so the British used these type of tactics to basically disproportionately give the land to the zionists that were coming from Europe and on purpose try to segregate out the Palestinians now what we also have in this time is we can't forget what happened in World wari too so in the late 1930s to escape the persecution of the Nazis more Jews came from Europe to Palestine to British mandate Palestine to flee obviously what happened we know the horrors of the Holocaust and which is you know an an unspeakable blemish on the history of humanity without without doubt so when the when the Jews started coming at this time they started organizing they organized paramilitary organ organizations they had terrorist organizations like the eron and the stern group of which manakan Bean one of the former prime ministers ahead of them and they not only used violence to force the Palestinians off the land but they also used violence to attack other Jews living in other countries to force them to immigrate to Palestine because traditionally up until this time the Jews that lived in Muslim lands I mean my mom grew up with Jews in Egypt and so did my father it was a it was a normal thing they interacted and you know but but they didn't want that they wanted all these people to come so they could suppl now remember that this is the Zionist movement the idea that we have to have our own Homeland that we have to do this by force so on and so forth British mandate ended uh on May 15th 1948 and you know like micros seconds later they they announced the establishment of the uh state of Israel and I think you know 5 seconds after that the United States recognized as Israel there's a war or you know aggression and this is what we refer to as the first in which hundreds of thousands hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced from their land many of them went to Gazza that's how a lot of these people that's why there are these families in GZA till today may Allah tal alleviate that suffering inshallah so now we have the formation of Israel now the the last major historical thing I want to mention to you uh before we talk about the possibility of peace is where sort of where we are now and the 1967 borders now based on what I presented you would conclude well Israel has no right to this land rather rather neither historically neither religiously neither from Land transaction so on and so forth of course an argument like that can be made and the more extreme approaches to the problem are making that argument but the story doesn't end there the story there have been many wars between the neighboring Arab countries and Israel in 1967 the United Nations issued resolution 242 you can look it up establishing borders for Israel and borders for what is called the Palestinian Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gazza and East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine when Egypt Jordan other countries make PE the I mean the Arab or Muslim countries make peace with Israel they acknowledge those borders so from a Sharia point of view the state of Israel is a recognized state it has diplomatic tie like in Egypt there's an Israeli Embassy the Israeli Ambassador lives there with his I don't know if he's still there but lives there with his family same thing with Jordan you see the flag flying in the where the embassy is I mean it's it's that means Egypt recognizes Israel and so Israel is a duly I don't want to use the word d it's a constituted state that is recognized by its neighbors along those borders according to that resolution 242 now of course a lot of Israelis will and pro zionists will will be very upset with what I'm saying and counter and saying this is not true and difference of interpretation okay I mean yeah but this is our Moss so we can say the way us and the vast majority of the Muslim World interprets it is that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are occupied illegally by these Israeli settlements and this is really where the tension is when the Palestinians many times were on the verge of making peace it was a huge compromise for the Palestinians to agree in the first place to this concept of the 1967 border because at that time they were under you know a a very uh they were very much convinced that there was no legitimacy to the state of Israel at all so the fact that they got to the point that they're acknowledging that there's a state of Israel that it has these borders but then these these lands on this side of the Border are ours that's a huge huge huge historic compromise from the Palestinian side so part of this UN resolution and this is you know the official policy of the United States whatever that means anymore and this is what international law stands for whatever that means anymore is that these are the borders so therefore the the West Bank the Gaza Strip are supposed to be the Sovereign pal state of Palestine and that land unfortunately has been settled illegally by by these settlers every single year since then till now to the point where it is there is no contiguity of the West Bank there's no contiguous State and this is what Ariel Chiron talked about you know changing the facts on the ground and things like that this is a systemic you know spreading of uh the state of Israel illegally and this is where a lot of the tension comes from now the last thing I want to say before we get to your questions is peace possible of course Peace is possible Allah is able to do all things but peace can only be possible with certain key things like there needs to be an independent Palestinian State along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital but Israel calls Jerusalem it's Eternal and undivided Capital you know they these type of words of aggression it's Eternal and undivided you know well where were you for the last 2,000 years this concern about Jerusalem when say om walked into Jerusalem and he asked the patriarch to show him where uh the the wall of of Bak was what the Jews called The Wailing Wall we call he it was a trash pit it was a dump the Romans were using it as a dump s Omar got off of his donkey and started took off his cloak and started sweeping it by himself so where is this concern of this eternal undivided Capital so the first issue of peace is there has to be there has to be a Palestinian State I mean obviously the the two-state solution or one state where everyone has equal rights but obviously they don't want to because they insist that Israel is a Jewish State not that Judaism is the religion of the state the way that Muslim countries name it no it's a Jewish State as if the state itself has a religion or the state itself has a gender or the state itself has feelings which is you know really illogical because a state is just is a construct the the state can have an official language an official religion you know Etc but they insist that it's a Jewish State there could be one one nation they can all be equal citizens but obviously because the Palestinians You Know M they have kids fast and then there the the issue of the Palestinians in the diaspora that will want to come back it could tilt statistically the problem so two-state solution a dismantling of the illegal settlements I mean obviously if you're going to have a state that you need to be able to walk and drive in it and work in it and probably the the most important thing is that they need to deal with this issue of Zionism because this idea that one race is better than another that one people is superior than another that God promised me this land six gazillion years ago and I'm going to kill every that's just not sustainable because that's not the way of the world it's it's it's it's a colonial nationalistic construct that many Jews I mean I know they are looked on by the Israeli and Zionist establishment as crazy but those Jews who are practicing Jews they are saying that this is an Aber bareny that this has nothing to do with the Jewish faith so they have to do something with that philosophy they have to unionist the state or I mean they have to come to terms with that and we can help them but there's something that they have to do on their own okay there's always peace is always possible we pray for peace alhamdulillah again I wanted to provide just these remarks to give you guys some points to consider to think about if you want to research some of these things I encourage you highly to research about them uh to look into them inallah um let's do the questions and um and then IMI can help me with that inshallah um okay there's significance of Jerusalem Palestine [Music] Etc uh uh okay a question about the spiritual significance of Palestine in relation TOA is the tomb of Moses and Jericho are the Moss tombs special significance in Gazza West Bank have they been destroyed how does Yemen figure into the present conflict well Jerusalem is believed to be by us uh the the of all of theia including the of s Muhammad s wasallam until the the changing of the from Jerusalem to Mecca uh but we do believe that the Kaa was built first uh and then Jerusalem was built several decades after that so Jerusalem is significant for the whole world not just for us uh and specifically for the abrahamic faiths it's the uh it was the of the Jews before us it was the land of Christ where the the whole Church of the Holy supper is there and of course it is the place of Al m uh in which you know the prophet engaged in the is and M uh you have to also know that when Jordan made peace with Israel in the 90s the Israelis acknowledged the hashemite family the royal family of of Jordan because they descendants of the Prophet the hashimites claims on the a of Masa which includes includes the Bak wall with the Jew refer to as the Wailing Wall the wall and the street all of that belongs to the W that is maintained by the hashimite family plus the Christian sites in East Jerusalem uh and I don't know if many Jews in our our in our in this area know that but this is what they acknowledge that this is you know it's under the custodianship of the of the hashimite family as far as the tombs of the Ambia there are many tombs Abraham Sarah M I think on the Jordanian side there's the tomb ascribed to Har we know with no certainty the tombs of any Prophet except s Muhammad Salli wasallam and this is one of the Miracles of s Muhammad Alat wasam all of them are approximation and Muslims have gone to those tombs throughout history uh to make Zara and things like that the prophet's great-grandfather Hashim is buried in gah so there's a mosque and a tomb for him there and in our own history Imam shaf was born in Gazza and grew up in Gazza and then came to Mecca as an oh he didn't grow up there he came to Mecca as as an infant as far as Yemen is concerned the huis in Yemen the the their um a Shia group in Yemen that are in control they have declared war on Israel and you know they're agitating in defense of Palestine that's a political thing do you want to add anything to that question okay uh death relating to War what is the Quran say about the Shahs and how does this relate to the present War what du were asked during specific Wars disasters Calamity as the Quran in what situations can the congregation pray janza be offered by us in iccp did for the Kun in congregational prayers there's a difference between the Shahid what we call the textbook Shahid and the person who dies the death of the Shahed the textbook Shahid is somebody who engage engages in a real Jihad for the sake of Allah tal protecting you know Islam and dies on the battlefield against the evildoers which basically doesn't exist because all wars are now you know somebody is paying somebody to do something that they don't want to do that's the textbook Shah like the people in bed the people that died in bed they're the sh those are the people that you don't wash you don't shroud you don't pray over you you B you bury them in their battle ear all cut in Blood and you you put them in the grave there are however many people that die the death of the Shahed meaning they get the reward of the Shahed the woman who dies in child birth the person who dies of of um uh of a pandemic a plague the person who drowns the person who burns uh the person who's defending their livelihood or their home or their their wealth those people die the death of the Shahed meaning they get the reward of the Shahid but outwardly from a point of view we still wash them shroud them pray janza on them and bury them so all of the people that are dying in they're in the latter category they're sh they're you know they get the reward of the Shahid but we still do the things that we need to do for the death as far as the absent janaza prayer yeah so the sh are alive with Allah subhana t as Allah tells us don't think that they are dead but they are alive with Allah subhana wa tala um so while we grieve on the outward we know that behind all of that is a great Mercy for them and for their families that are still alive waiting them inshallah because these children will take their parents inshallah into the into the heaven into Paradise as far as the absent janza prayer we can pray the absent janaza prayer at any time for somebody who has been prayed on or for somebody who hasn't been prayed upon as far as we can make du which is when we say in the last ra of any prayer far prayer sunah prayer at any time of Calamity so it's something that we are permitted to do and it's open-ended and you make Dua for those who are oppressed you know those those who are oppressed so that's a Sunnah practice that can be done um but because the Calamity is so long in this situation now I think we're like week seven now probably what we would want to do is just include them in our Dua after the prayer because if every prayer we do a on the last ra then people will start to think that that's how we pray so we also don't want that to happen so I mean it's fine if we did it but what we would probably do institutionally is that every time we make Dua like we did after prayer today we would mention them in the Dua insh okay explaining the Gazza conflict to our kids and family three points I should mention at the dinner table when the kids ask about the conflict is this a religious War Jew versus Muslim well the most important thing I would I would mention is that there is an illegal occupation of Palestinian land and that's something that we have to constantly mention this land is occupied illegally and that is the source of the problem the source of the problem are not the Palestinians the source of the problem is not what happened on October 7th the source of the problem is not this group or that group even though we we uh we are we we condemn the killing of any innocent Soul because we acknowledge that there are innocent Israelis that's separate that's a separate issue but the source like I said in the what's the usle what's the source of all of this it's the illegal occupation of the land number two there is a difference in our understanding between Zionism and Judaism we have no problem with Judaism we love the Jews like we love all all of the people of the book with all faiths Islam has coexisted with everybody we have no problem whatsoever but there is a problem with a philosophy that posits that one people is superior than another that one group is better than another that one person's life is more valuable than another that's a problem not just for us that's that should be a problem for all of humanity because that's what Hitler said and and we' and we've been condemning him you know every chance we get and this is in the same it's obviously different but it's in the same vein that's the second point is that that distinction and number three is the importance I think of just the act of talking about it reading about it educating ourselves because obviously there are many many many details that I'm not talking about uh so you have to become more educated and there are a lot of resources online alhamdulillah now and books which is my preferred method mine encouragement is for people to read to allow their children to read and to remember the importance of Jerusalem and and you know the things that we mentioned that theia are buried there and the Masa we have to continue to remember these things so they don't fade because we cannot forget about this about this importance do you have any you mentioned some sources last time I don't know if that was about this topic did you have sources that you want to mention question for kids I mean in general any sources do you have any IDE so for children um there's a video resource uh that was uh provided by new kids people are familiar with new kids because they send out the uh books every month and they have a video series but they did a special program on how to talk about Palestine with your kids I think it's good for any kids that are within the age of 6 to 12 6 to 13 that might be a good resource if you have older children I think at that age they should learn the history like as Dr th mentioned um because I think that sometimes we we want to like save them we just want to give them like the end conclusion without getting too in into the history but I think it's beneficial to get into that so there's a Hundred Years War um that's probably I think and very easy to read easy to read it's very easy to read and and very current and you know he himself is a Palestinian so he has he fills the story with anecdotes of members of his family that witness a lot of these things there are a lot there were other questions about what are good explanation or sources as to the current conflict that's a harder question because it's very hard to get good information I think most people now are relying on social media the Democracy Now might be a good source I think for getting information yeah I mean the the problem with what's happening now is that almost every single thing that we were told in the first four to 5 days from the Israeli side or the American side almost all of it has now been debunked so what that tells me is I don't know what the hell is going on I really don't know I don't know who to well I know who not to believe let me say that but I want to know like the actual like the AL hospital that whole thing happened when I was in Egypt I was between KIRO and am men okay in the Arab world today this is an established fact that the IDF bombed hospital if you ask people here they'll say the exact opposite the truth now that I I heard yesterday that they're saying that the audio uh of the of the Islamic Jihad Fighters that they had saying that this was arm was arm missile they're saying that the audio was fabricated I mean I don't know I don't know what the source of that is but because of my training one of the things that we are trained in is how to accept information Allah says in the Quran if somebody comes to you a crooked person with information you know verify in one you know verify this piece of information our whole Dean is based on verification the prophet also said it's enough to be called a liar that you repeat everything that you hear so when it comes to this issue I'm just giving you an example if you ask anybody I think the Turkish TV they did like an expose on this the AL Hospital everyone in the Arab world it's an it's a it's a it's a it's a fact that this was an IDF in my book I'm like I don't care about that hospital because look at all the other hospitals that are being bombed since then look at all the other schools that have been bombed so when it comes to this current issue current conflict you have to be very careful like everyone else I'm primarily using Twitter I follow certain people uh that I think are are being fair uh and you know I try to do my best to you know to weed between the things today was a new surprise there was uh the former prime minister of Israel Bak was being interviewed by oh my God I mean I was I was going to post something he was like oh those are the tunnels that we put down there you see that yes yes Subhan and Christian aapor was shocked she was like well I think you you misspoke I I don't think I heard you correctly she was giving him a chance to did you say like of course yeah we built it because they have a space problem so we helped with the space problem so we build them their tunnels right so you know it's that's what that that's why we call it the fog of War because in the middle of War uh what I do know is I believe nothing absolutely nothing that comes from Israeli officials on the IDF I I I I think they are complete Liars I think that nothing is beyond them I think they've lost their minds I've said that so it's almost almost as if the truth is the opposite of what they they say I mean if Benjamin nyaho came right now and said it's raining outside I wouldn't believe him until I went outside myself that's how much of a liar I think these people are so be very careful and unfortunately America the state department and the White House they're not even verifying information they're just repeating what they say like the 40 babies things right the 40 babies just just Pierce Morgan repeated that that Hames beheaded people uh in the October 7th I'm not defending Hames but I'm saying they didn't not behead anyone and now we found out that the IDF killed their own people in on October 7th those burned bodies that were Mark regev who I who I've had a personal interaction with when I was a freshman in college but it's another story but Mark reg said we we downgraded our estimates of when he was being interviewed by Mahi Hassan he said we downgraded our estimates of Israelis killed on October 7th because there were some bodies that were so badly burned it turned out that they were Hamas Fighters how were those bodies burned Hamas doesn't have anything they don't have a sea port they don't have an airport they have nothing it's a blockade so obviously they were burned by those Apache helicopters that came from the Israeli side and because they have the Hannibal directive where they kill their own people and they killed those people so it's so messy that you you have to be very very careful in the current climate to to uh ascertain what's going on and that's why you have to turn to Allah subhana wa tala another question is about Arab countries except Qatar and Jordan silent about the conflict no that's not true okay because uh there are certain things that certain countries can do and then there are certain things that they can't do the most important thing at the very beginning of the conflict was that both the Egyptians and the jordanians said under no circumstance are these people to be relocated neither to the Sinai nor nor past uh east of the Jordan River the Jordanian foreign minister said that any relocation of Palestinians from the West Bank to Jordan will be considered a declaration of an act of war and president CeCe immediately moved divisions of the Egyptian armed for forces into the Sinai to bolster this idea he forced the RAF border opened as much as possible because there's also the Israeli side the Israeli side controlled and they have a choke hold on the humanitarian Aid going on but he said you know they said many times we will we will we will die by the millions to defend one grain of sand of Sinai I mean he was very clear so that's important because that's what the Israelis want that's their first option since the 1960s or whatever 70s they have been trying to move these people into the sin so that they can just occupy Gaza and then it becomes Egypt's problem they live in tent cities or whatever and it's just we forget about them and that's why we use the word genocide because that's what a genocidal thinking does does to displace People based on their ethnic background and the same thing with Jordan so but at the same time Egypt and Jordan you know you know October 8th or 9th I think America moved two aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean right off the coast of Israel I mean fighting Israel is also going to be a declaration of war against America so there's just certain things that the countries can't do uh just I saw today that the Saudi foreign minister has been making rounds China Russia um so I think they are trying to apply diplomatic pressure unfortunately the Diplomatic pressure is not working the way we want primarily because America not even America our commander-in chief who is completely scile he completely he has lost it he has lost I mean he has lost credibility he's lost it I think he's lost his mind is just allowing them his own administration his own Administration is blinkin is telling him in the press conference to shut up because he's saying things that he's not supposed to say this one man in that downtown he is the one that's allowing them them to do that and that's really where the issue is so don't be so oh the the Muslims suck and the Muslim leaders suck and it's not that simple it's not that simple everyone is happy about erdogan because you know he he had the rally and he spoke tough words but at the end of the day the governments are still stuck in this situation where there's only so much that they can do but they are trying to apply diplomatic pressure I'm not defending them I'm just saying you know politics is real and you have to understand that there are real considerations it's not obvious you see that's the thing the truth is not obvious to the people in the west the average American the average Western European they really believe that Hamas is like Isis it's like what happened in 911 they believe that I mean if you talk if if if if our Jewish neighbors heard if I went to their congregation I spoke like this they would they would be crying they would be thinking that I'm advocating their death it's so in grained in them because of this history of persecution they they are told that yeah I mean that's why we have to continue to talk about it we have to continue to talk about it but we have to talk about it like this with facts and to be calm we can't get excited we can't lose our temper we because that's that's not who we are you we are the people of s Muhammad S at the end of the day so but the they they really believe this many people really believe that Hamas is like Isis they cut they raped women they cut they killed babies they beheaded the babies they're still saying that even though all of that's been debunked they're still repeating that you're asking why are they supportive that's why yeah no of course yeah but you don't I it's very important when you're dealing with in a situation like this you have to understand how the other person thinks how the other person feels you have to be empathetic to that we I I I understand that these people I have been I mean wait till Friday wait till Friday insh what is the best way to support those who are afflicted in the conflict well you know we need to cons this we need to talk about it educate ourselves we need to make Dua for them and I don't know what are we doing on the aid stuff have we identified an organization that we can give to that's helping so we started a a campaign to collect donations to support uh those those affected in Gazza and there are two organizations that we're supporting uh that all of you are supporting uh UNICEF as well as Doctors Without Borders Doctors Without Borders even prior to October was operating hospitals in Gazza and so they have staff and they have people and so this uh takes care of medical supplies um in Gazza but I would add one more um most of the aid being provided to RZA right now these trucks are being arranged by the US unrwa is the main organization operating in vaza so that's another organization to look okay somebody's asking about boycotts uh so the thing about boycott boycotting is maybe we should just abstract it because you know the whole BDS movement is is a boogeyman for the you know pro-israeli or Pro Zionist opinion and let me just simply state that all of us are consumers and you all we live in a free country and you are free to buy and not buy whatever you want it's that simple now I look at because I used to be on you know in the coffee business I look at traceability so my concern when I buy something is can I trace this product back to make sure that no child labor has been done it wasn't done on like illegal land it's what we would call ethical so there is a space for that and an importance for that way Beyond just this conflict because there are people that are being exploited animals that are being tortured you know like the a lot of the um far um cosmetic companies you know they test chemicals on animals and they burn their eyes it's horrible stuff really really horrible stuff so I want us to talk about not boycotting but I want us to talk about ethical uh purchasing and trying for us to commit to buying traceable items in addition to supporting our own businesses for for not for this reason for all whole host of reasons so there are you know the biocal movement I remember it was in fad maybe now it's not in fad anymore but we have we have businesses that are in our area that are local that's just a better way of operating in general so that's how I look at the at the at the process is boycotting a company effective absolutely people go out of business all the time because the people don't buy their product there's corporate Espionage that's even more dirty than the stuff that we're talking about I mean that stuff is really filthy because it's all for profit so that that stuff happens all the time so is it effective yes if it's done collectively the problem is or maybe one of my critiques is that it's done it's it's stated only for this conflict but we have other conflicts like the Wagers in China like the rohinga like you know you just then list goes on and on and on so I think that we should talk about it in the wider context so that it's more robust this would be one of those conflicts but if I know that this product was made in a factory in an illegal settlement in the West Bank of course I'm not going to buy it why would I do that I would see that as Haram I mean I don't need to buy it uh and we know alhamdulillah as Americans we're free to do that and there's we have like a gazillion options if you just go to any store there's we call SKS the SKU you know we have millions of SKS millions of options I think uh you know the challenge with the BDS movement it can be very effective but we live in an age of mnc's multinational corporations and franchises so people are like oh this happened in Coca-Cola in Israel so we're going to boycott Coca-Cola International the problem is it's a big Corporation they have so many factories so many branches what happens in one McDonald's is different from what happens in another McDonald's so I think it's beneficial but in in Sharia we have this concept Al and so it's like something that's good but there's something a lot better what's a lot more effective um than boycotting what's more effective is that we live in Maryland we live in America we have access to lawmakers we should be calling them every day we should be flooding their phone lines we should be telling them that we're calling for ceasefire but we don't mostly out of laziness right so whatever time that we're spending in social media you know getting really depressed looking at video after video after video um we should do something productive and uh over the last few weeks um myself and the rest of the Muslim leadership in Maryland we've been visiting all of the lawmakers we've met with the Senators and some of the congressmen and they all told us the same thing they said behind the scenes we're talking to the president uh they don't want to use the word ceasefire because ceasefire sounds like Hamas WIS right and they they need need more political support from us I think a lot of the congressmen especially after asifa hospital that was a big Turning Point politically uh well they found nothing yeah there's nothing there so I think it was a big embarrassment for the administration the guy said there's like 16 uh AK-47s in the MRI room what happens when you go take an MRI you have to be naked you strip naked if you have your necklace or anything it messes up the MRI room so they have all this machine it's all it's just so that guy is that IDE of guy is such a goof the guy that pointed to the calendar and said this is the shift the ham the terrorists are making shift I mean this guyy is such a goof yeah so it's not going to work personally I think that we should take advantage of the most effective tool which we have which is our political representation uh how do you assess the impact of international stands taken by Muslim countries I mean I mentioned that I I think that immediately everyone was saying the same thing uh the humanitarian cost Collective punishment everyone all of the heads of state that I know of condemned Hamas condemned the killing of the Innocents I thought uh his majesty King Abdullah in the Arab Summit in Cairo spoke very well when he said we have received the message loud and clear our lives don't matter as much as yours and this was in the very beginning before any of the the the original quote unquote facts were debunked and I thought Queen R's two U public appearances I think on with Christian am in po were also she was very well spoken she herself is Palestinian and I think they've all said the same thing but I think there is no agreement on how we can stop the problem and that's a a larger political problem that's beyond beyond my skill set so I don't know I don't have access to intelligence those people have access to intelligence I speak to people who have access to intelligence but their access is also limited and what I do know is that when I because I do work with people in the intelligence community in the the Muslim World on different issues is when you have access to intelligence you you see the you see the whole thing in a different uh In a Different Light altogether I was given a brief in a Latin American country I don't want to name it about a certain Islamic group I don't want to name it and it's something that happened in the past but they were giving it to me and I was trying to critique their response or trying to explain it to them and I was absolutely shocked absolutely shocked about what they told me and I'm like okay yeah I don't have and that's just one little micro in incident so you have to understand that these people countries and states they have intelligence they have interests they have economies and uh all of these are part of the calculation so if you do not have access to that those type of intelligence briefings you are not going to have access to the whole to the whole you know the whole deck or what they're dealing with I'm not saying that this excuses them and we can always use this as an excuse I'm just saying that it's not always one for one is what I'm trying to say and I don't think it's healthy for us to critique those Muslim countries I think we we need to be doing what IMI is doing and take care of our own backyard I think you're being very generous to Islamic countries I don't have any confidence in them doing anything so we live in America we live in a democracy and we have a power to do something why are we looking to them we should look at what we do we should look at ourselves first like against the Jew he dies there is he to be Shah no Jihad is there is no Jihad without AA the prophet s wasallam said without a political Banner yeah Jihad or or in this case War has to be declared by a State against the state or a state defending itself against an invasion but I'm going to go to Country a and and fight there's no cross country Jihad nothing like that so that that's you in his mind he is confusing two or three things he's crossing the wires on two or three things permission has been given by Allah for people who are being oppressed for them to resist their oppressors and Allah is able over them to give is able to give them Victory this is a standard in all religions it's standard international law that if you are oppressed if you are occupied if you are being treated under unjustly you have the right to resist this is international law article 51 of the so it's it's a standard thing this is a it's it's so standard that it's considered a universal human right so anybody we just said that their land is occupied so obviously they're going to resist I mean that's only the natural human instinct but I can't go and resist for them but I can like what im is saying I can uh Lobby here I can try to put pressure on my government here to not give them Aid that's our form of resistance and resistance by the way is not necessarily vient there are other forms of resistant I'm just saying the concept of resisting the oppress oppressor is a stand it's a human right it's AAL natural human right what are the most significant obstacles in achieving lasting peace between Israel and Palestine the the racism of the Zionist uh philosophy that's the main problem they I mean and now it's so obvious it's so obvious uh that our lives do not matter Palestinian lives do not matter I mean they are openly talking they said this is a a war of civilization over barbarism light over Darkness they're citing dubious passages of scripture to justify genocidal actions that's the problem if that's the person with the power and that's the person that America is that's the problem the problem is not ham and Israelis themselves are saying this they're saying the biggest obstacle to peace is our government not Hames because Israel gave rise to Hames Israel funded Hames allowed Hames to be funded now I doesn't mean that I support Hames or I or I justify the killing of innocent people we just said that that's Haram absolutely but it's Haram on both sides not on one side versus the other so when they can say that what what we're saying now it's wrong on both sides it's against Judaism on both sides then then we're going to get somewhere to peace but as long as they that belief in their heart exists that they are superior that they are are better that they are Justified there will never be peace and that's why the burden is on them not on the Palestinians uh just to add to that you know I as you know I have a lot of conversations with rabbis that I know and Jewish organizations that we work with and many of them have asked the same question that doesn't Israel have a right to defend itself and what do you expect Israel to do about Hamas and I have a very easy and a very simple answer to that which is that Hamas is not supposed to be there in the first place place the reason that Hamas is there is because in 2006 at the end of the second in um Hamas was successful in the in that one election and the reason they were successful was because Israel funded them and did not fund the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority is supposed to exercise sovereignty over Gaza under the ASO Accords ASO Accords one and ASO Accords two so who's supposed to be in razza it's supposed to to be the Palestinian Authority this whole uh conflict can be over right away if the Palestinian Authority is given authority over Gaza again and then they won't have any problem with Hamas but the reason that the Israeli authorities will not allow that to happen is they don't want to see a unified Palestine because if there's a unified Palestine then there's a possibility of two states and one of the political goals is to eliminate the possibility of a Palestinian State altogether and to make a two-state solution possible which is not about land it's about the philosophy it's the idea that's that's the engine behind this policy but they can dismantle the settlements just like they carpet bombed Gazza in 3 four weeks they can have these crazy settlers go back to the heart land of Israel and give the West Bank back so that's not like not not a real obstacle that's not a real justification and all of those guys are crazy people from Brooklyn anyway and Staten Island and queens I mean seriously if you hear them talk they all talk with a New York accent they're lunatics even the right-wing government calls them lunatics that just to show you how crazy those people are so it's not about that's not a real obstacle the real again you have to think from the first point what's the real issue the real issue is they believe that they are Justified they don't want a two-state solution they want to annihilate these people they want them to kick them out so on and so forth okay the last question here is considering the current events how should we shape our spiritual perspective or conversely how might our spiritual beliefs influence our understanding and reaction to these events this is just an event just like there are events all throughout our life at the end of the day we have to continue to do the things that Allah established Us in doing now we know they have thei of the Prophet Sall wasallam said if in your hand is a is a seed and the hour is upon you in It's the End of Time plant your seed why would you plant your seed if it's in two seconds no one's going to see the plant right because that's what Allah asks us to do that's the perspective of the believer I'm going to do what I have been established to do to the best of my ability until the day I die we're all going to die and from that point of view our individually starts when we die it doesn't matter when the end of time is going to come or when the M comes back we don't have to worry about that if he comes back we'll deal with it then so I'm not trying to belittle from the conflict but I'm the history is filled of these times Bagdad was sacked by the mo Mogul in invasion in the 13th century and the Khalifa was brought in the street and executed in the street and the books were thrown in the Tigers and euphrat they said that the horses could walk across the river from all of the books that were thrown I mean this is nothing compared to that this is nothing compared to the passing of s Muhammad sahu alaihi wasallam this is nothing compared to the F between the sahab this is nothing compared to the collapse of the Ottoman this is nothing compared to the loss of Andalusia this is really small in comparison to those things the difference is that many of us have never seen something like this in our lifetime and even though horrible things have happened in our lifetime because of this we are seeing it I mean I just just before I came the people that I was following she was killed I'm we were like you know I feel like we're like friends I'm looking at her post and then she's she she's dead she got she got a missile hit the place she died just like that I've never experienced something like that now you read about them but this is what's making us feel that perhaps it's it is different In Our Lifetime but in the span of human history horrible things have happened all the time inshallah we will prevail the truth will prevail peace will prevail but we have to be ready to be those people and my most important message two things is not to give up hope ever we are a people of hope uh and resilience and number two we cannot let this conflict and we cannot let the antagonist change our behavior before I came maybe you guys got a chance to see this absolutely insane former Obama Diplomat who's harassing the Halal uh truck vendor in New York did you guys see him this guy is absolutely insane he he goes up to this Egyptian guy and he says you know please forgive me and he said do you rape your daughter the way Muhammad raped AA that's what he said it's on video you're going to go home and you're going to see it I mean how would you react if someone said that I mean I I I was I was going to break the phone when I you know and I and I was I was thinking the the guy in the in the in the truck I mean kudos to he didn't react he didn't react and he said you know we killed uh 4,000 Palestinians and that's not we've killed 4,000 children that's not enough it first started people were sharing his video like who is this guy and then it turned out that this guy was a senior Diplomat in the Middle East in the Obama Administration the important thing is that we cannot let that man or people like him change our attitude we are going to be the people of Peace Love Harmony coexistence no matter what what those people do we are not going to let they are so vile they are so racist they are so they have so much hatred inside them we need to help them come back to their Humanity that's the atude that we should have don't give up hope and don't let these people change your attitude change who you are and inshallah we will find that calm and we will prevail that's what I would say one one of the most powerful things is seeing how Calamity affects the believer you know when you see the people in Gaza and you see their videos and they find out that their brother passed away that their children have been mared and they say alhamdulillah and so for us like our faith is shaken but it's amazing to see how their faith is not shaken and in the Ayah that Dr mentioned the next Ayah is that they are joyous they are at peace they're happy and satisfied with what Allah has given and not only that so they give Glad Tidings to others those after them those their relatives after them to those that are going to join them later on right so that is that is a good Tiding so the Muslim mindset is different right so sometimes we're like oh the umah is weak oh the countries are weak oh the people are losing people have died the thing is we don't we don't that's not the math that we use right when we look at the conflict and we see somebody that's martyred we think that Subhan Allah perhaps Allah subhanahu waala wanted to fill jna with the children of that's how we look at it and when we see a tyrant getting away with something we say that that Allah subhana perhaps he will take care of them in this world and if he doesn't then it's not like oh well they'll get their punishment later no it's because the the the Hellfire is a lot more severe of a punishment for them so it could be that Allah wants punishment for them so he facilitates for them opportunity I'm not saying I know that but perhaps Allah is facilitating that situation in order for them to be deserving of such punishment the last thing I'll mention is that between the fourth and the fifth crusade does anybody know how many years that b mdus was occupied by the Crusaders do you know almost 188 years 88 the numbers are a little bit you know it depends which area and which City but Jerusalem I'm talking that's why it will be 100 years if you include the surrounding areas but Jerusalem was occupied for 88 years razza has been uh well Gazza is less than that but Palestine has been occupied for 75 years so we have to put this in historical context that the situation is this way but Allah subhanahu wa taala is always in control of all reality and he can change everything so everything transpires exactly the way that Allah subh tal my brother just sent me the video because he just found out about the guy deputy director in the US state Department's office of Israel and Palestine affairs from 1999 to 2003 anyway I want to end with a story a personal story when I was a freshman in college uh I entered College in the fall of 1997 so after Christmas break 1998 it was the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel and I came back from from break and the entire campus was one big Israeli flag okay so coming from the background that I I came from you know I'm I feel like I'm G to you know I got to do something and I met Mark regive who you you know one of these guys who you just want to you know punch when you hear him speak on the TV and I challenged him and he publicly humiliated me in a way I've never been humiliated in my entire life and I realized walking back defeated to my dorm room I realized I have no idea what I'm talking about and this guy that's all he knows all he knows is this issue he doesn't know anything else but all he knows is this he eats breathes drinks this issue so you know maybe for like the rest of the semester and the summer I read a lot about this issue but I also realized something else that there's really no utility in debating people like him because obviously he's not going to change and I'm not going to know more about the details than he is so I dedicated myself that was one of the crucial moments for me that I really need to learn not just about this issue but my religion and I need to be equipped and number two you have to be very strategic in who you talk to and who you interact with so I also want to caution us and our community people that are watching that we need to also think about that there's I don't want to debate a Zionist there's no point in that but I want to teach the community and I want us to be resilient and I want your kids to know the truth and the history that's what matters our our our we're not here to combat with people to argue with people or anything like that we know what's right we know it's wrong almost every single thing that we've talked about tonight we can give you the reference for it these things have been historically documented many of these have been documented by Israeli historians themselves not even Arab historians so there's no secrets to what we're saying but you need to fortify yourself with the details of the situation and you need to learn not to engage when it's not uh tactically smart or strategically smart you have to be very careful in how you engage on this issue and from that time this is the first time and look how long it's been from 1998 till now you know almost 30 years this is the first time I have publicly spoken maybe I spoke once that I rallied downtown the first time that I publicly speak about this issue because now it's I'm in a different position and you you're looking to me and IMI to guide the community but also what's happening now is just ridiculous I mean we have to speak out so and we will speak out but notice for for almost 30 years I have not spoken about it because you need to grow strong to be ready to give back when the time time is right so I just want you to think about that it's a story I'll never forget that feeling of being publicly humiliated uh and it was an important lesson and for that I thank you Mark regiv for humiliating me publicly are there any last minute questions no inshallah yeah it takes time no I just to no please please eler English okay they're in Gaza still reporting and they onl well they're all with the IDF and they're not allowed to report until the IDF sees what they're going to report on yeah those are the people that I'm talking about like you follow like five six of them and then by the end of the week one or two of them dies yeah okay good so Al jaaz English I have a question a lot of efforts are being made uh to form a political action you know uh commed P so our zakat money and Saka money can we contribute towards that effort with with it qualify it depends how the pack is formed you know if it's a bunch of uncles that want to take all of our money so that they can put their friend uh sorry I need to be blunt their white friend into office so that they can do them favors no that's not zaket but if it's a pack that is dealing with serious issues that are affect affecting us and our children and this you know islamophobia that's happening yeah this would be a this would be zable so it depends because I've been with all of those meetings you know for the last 10 years II is newer so maybe but I so I can I'm telling you a lot of that stuff is very very misguided you know my position on this a lot of that is misguided and there are people in our community and I tell them that to their face but if it's structured correctly then it could be zakat uh zakat we have a few question online alikum thank you very much for all this information would you please make me understand two things one is the star of the David second is I've been seeing these many I mean videos and many lectures happening in Israel itself especially they have involed the young youth the their youth makes a zigger like a zig with and says then cries this is having been allowed by David to have this land and this is our land god is we are superior to others and God has told us so in that s i remember the god telling us that and and we have certainly chosen them with the knowledge over all the worlds and is that then how can I respond to a person to a person who quotes me this thing that we are superior because they are now telling we are superior they have been telling now they are also their youth ising we are super to others and we have a promised this land and they name that's Star of David could youe make me understand the Star of David in Islamic history has been called the Seal of Solomon and it's used in Islamic Art and people wear it as rings and there are uh you know literature that's been written about it I think I rajab H has his Treatise on rings he talks about it so it's it's it's something that is attributed to both suan and D who are our MBA so that's that's where it comes from so it's not only a Jewish thing it's say Prophet prophetic thing as far as them saying that this land is promised to us that's like saying you know so I'm not going to go pray it's the same thing but that's the whole that's why I began by talking about the reform movement because they're reinterpreting their text okay yeah even the Quran says you know that's been you know promised to you but then they said so I yeah okay it was promised to them but they reneged on the promise and that's why the rinic and Orthodox Community says it's forbidden for us to go because we violated God's Commandments and therefore we are not allowed to go back that's where the difference inside Judaism isn't the interpretation please speak about this and in this also in talmud they have taken a different thing and in the talmud they have put a very different map which includes Eastern Eastern Asia much of the Middle East and almost whole of the Europe and they have Market it and they have printed it and put it aside tal I don't know nobody has reacted so far to it so as you know so as Muslims we say the T but the Jewish they have the tanak the tanak is the tah and additional books that form the Hebrew Bible in the very beginning of the tah in the very beginning of the Hebrew Bible you have the Book of Genesis so in the Book of Genesis there's a verse in which Moses is approaching he's in Jordan and he's in this Valley I think Mount Nebo right and he's looking into the land of of Canan the land of Palestine and there's a verse that here is the promised land right for you and your seed so uh traditionally the in the in the talmud the Jewish Scholars and the rabbis they interpreted this some interpreted that this is promised to all of the Jewish people but actually that's not the wording of the verse the wording is that this has been promised to you and your seed so others they said it means you personally right uh prophet and your seed meaning the Messi the Messiah that's going to come and this is why for hundreds of years Christians never believed in this concept of Palestine being promised to the Jews why because it was superseded by the coming of the Messiah so who's the messiah for for Jews I mean for Christians it's for Muslims it's also it's Jesus the son of Mary so it is only promised for when the Messiah comes under the Orthodox uh Jews which are about 10% of the Jews in America they are still waiting uh for the Messiah to come actually they are prohibited in their teaching in the rinic teaching from entering into Palestine and living and forming a state and that's been the Messiah and that's been the teaching for thousands of years that's that's what I was trying to say why the understanding the history of the reform movement is so important because it's critical to understanding how we got to Zionism so the Evangelical belief that Israel belongs to Jews contradicts the Jewish teachings enough and it also contradicts Christian teachings as well there's also another issue related to this I didn't want to get into but there have been some many geneological studies to demonstrate that European Jews the ashkanazi are not related at all to actual Jews uh and that's another truth you know that this is a I'm not saying that they're not Jewish I'm just saying there's no lineal descent from the original Jews to the people that claimed that this was the land that I am I am a direct descendant of is my family traces itself back to the uncle of the Prophet s wasallam and then from him to is to IIM I am genetically abrahamic much more than what these people can can claim and that's also another thing that people are trying to to make an argument for yeah we're here did our Prophet say our um won't pass more than 1,400 years on earth related to this war no no these are just Traditions about my um will last a day or half a day and then the people then try to interpret how long the umah will last and you find this in many of in in some of the Sufi literature lure that will try to predict how long the um will last the problem with that is and you know I'm trained in TAS so I'm being self-critical but the problem is that I don't have um the problem of that is this so if this piece of paper represents time okay this is me and then this is the future okay so when you stand on time and you read about things like at the end of time you see them far away Allah says you see it far away but we see it close so the Sufi tends to see it like this right I'm here and the is here but that's a result of like it would work better if it was a string but that's the result of the spirit spiritual practice because when you are in that spiritual Zone you see okay yeah I mean it's going to happen so you will find in the Tas literature that the um will only last X number of uh years and things like that the criticism from the of that is that y slow down you're just experiencing that this is the situation so I I would Advocate that and we'll see what happens if it ends it ends I don't know if we have time for this can you talk about the impact of the fall of Ottoman Empire the impact of the fall of the Ottoman Empire yeah this is a big one I mean it ended it ended in in this this March inshallah we will be commemorating a 100 years it ended in March of 1924 T I want to be very careful because we have Turkish people in our community for when I start talking about Ur I'm not going to say anything good and then everyone gets mad at me so the best thing is just to say from a hisorical point of view I don't like to judge history this was good or this was bad it happened Allah wanted it to happen and it happened and therefore we deal with it so the way I look at it is what there have been many responses to the problem of the end of the Ottoman there have been four main responses very quickly one response is the response is oh my God this is a catastrophe the reason we lost all of our worldly Powers because we've left Islam we have to go back to the pristine teachings of Islam Islam this is the fundamentalist salafi wahabi response that's a response one of the responses to that problem the second response is the exact opposite this is amazing now we can free ourselves from the things that held us back we can be modernized we'll be clean shaven wear western clothes we'll change the alphabet uh you know we can modify the prayer they want to reform reform Islam so there has been a reform movement you know from the early 1900s till today you know like the Quran only people that I always make fun of things like that emerge those are like reformers let's look at science if the prophet was alive now he would be using toothpaste he would be using it doesn't make sense that a a girl should get half the inheritance of her brother that's not fair they just want to change everything that they don't like to make sense the third response is the Messianic response oh my God this is a disaster This is the End of Time the m is coming I'm the Mahi so you have many people that call themselves MDI like the MDI of Sudan you laugh but people died you know the M movement in Sudan and then there's the fourth response which is called thei response which is the response I'm trying to pass on to all of you which is okay you know what happens when it hits the fan things happen it's okay but we have a way of dealing with it the way that the umah before us dealt with it we have to go back to our principles to solve our problem so if you want to talk about the collapse of the Ottoman Empire rather than offending my Turkish brothers and sisters uh we would just say that these are the four responses that happened now in the response of the salafi movement salafi wahhabi which were historical things from this can come the extreme people theage Isis Dash things like that they can come that extreme form from the reformed people you know they end up like leaving Islam or saying weird things or alcohol is Hal all of you have one point in time oh I heard that alcohol is halal I heard that this is all that weird stuff that happens it can come from that and then the Messianic thing actually does happen so one of the most drastic and dramatic of the Messianic movements was Jean who occupied the Haram in Mecca in 19 it was think 1979 1979 he went with his people and he occupied the Haram now that started because people were having dreams in Medina including him that he was going to be chosen and he was going to be some kind of Messianic figure and uh by the way bin Bez was there no one likes to talk about that but he was in that group as well and that led him to do that so this Messianic movement it's not just so funny that somebody claims it the Mahi but people start reading into I'm chosen to do this you know I'm I need to do this and Allah's talking to me and I need to go do something right now it's a form of Messianic messianism that can be very very dangerous and often times leads them to Bloodshed so the fall of the Ottoman Empire I think that we should look at it like that why did the Ottoman Empire fall I mean everything that goes up has come down M they ruled for like 800 years but they there was debt that happened and there were Wars and the Ottoman Empire was so widespread it was impossible at that time to control I mean America now with its basis it's hard to control this was like a contiguous land mass uh that was almost impossible to hold all at the same time at that time with the technology plus they started to lose the countries in the Balkans and you know it just it was a it was a and the world war one really is what kind of decimated the issue with the rise of nationalism to form the national the the modern a Turkish Republic so you know those are some of the reasons why but but it's a historical uh incident that I like to just look at the history of it and learn what the responses were okay um is there honest dialogue in the Interfaith circles involving imams rabbis prach and pleas Friday's kba is going to be exactly on this topic me and IMI have been talking a lot about this as you know I have a lot of experience in Interfaith I have raised tens of millions of dollars in the name of coexist and Interfaith I have dealt with the Vatican Evangelical communities Jewish communities I have dealt with Cambridge University Yale Georgetown uh I have a lot of experience and what is happening now is a failure of the Interfaith Network all sorts of networks whether it be locally nationally internationally to address this problem it's very sad for us because since 911 we have been very vocal very much out there talking to people we have condemned our own people more than we have condemned anyone else because you know some of the people that are Muslims do crazy things we've done all of that and now is the turn for the world to come to support these innocent people that are being massacred for no reason it's a genocide I mean that's what it is and the fact that the Interfaith Community any Interfaith Community whether it be very local or very International can't do that means it's a fundamental failure of those networks and then therefore if those communities do not step up for the sake of humanity they have lost all moral legitimacy all moral legitimacy and we will work with whoever is left because our religion teaches us the importance of coexistence it's a it's a command uh from Allah and will continue to do it but I have to be honest it is very sad it's very sad but I want M to also share because you know he's also unfortunately had to deal with it firsthand it's really you know how they say in times of crisis you find out who your friends are so I think we're finding out um and the the interesting thing is I don't I think you would be hardpressed to find individuals more diplomatic than Dr th and myself you know we speak in terms of of first principles we speak about uh human rights and the Dignity of life and the fact and we self-censor ourselves many times there many times we just there are certain things we don't talk about because we know won't go over well with people that's right and we're and we're also sensitive to the feelings and the sentiments of other communities and their traumatic histories we we are but at the same time we don't waver on recognizing right and wrong and what's been very disappointing is the fact that some of the other Faith communities um are either complicit in encouraging genocide or are silent and they have opportunities to take a moral stand but they don't want to do so because they don't want to face any scrutiny or they don't want to be accused of being anti-semitic and so because of that they stand on the sidelines and I think thak and I agree that that's not acceptable in this time and we're not looking to get into Politics as you know we're aest it we're not involved in making political statements but when the current events implicate issues of ethics and moral we can't be Sil okay I think sister SAS want to find out if we can host a call Bank uh call elected officials at Juma uh after Juma at iccp so uh con this is connected to the point that I just said we asking them to come asking these politicians to come no they're asking for a call call back so as a mjid we are restricted in political activities that we can legally engage in and at the same we have diversity of thought within our community not everybody has the same views but there are other organizations in Montgomery County we have mcmc so I would encourage everybody to reach out to the Muslim County uh Council and ask them what they're doing for for Palestine and ask them to organize it and if and if a venue is needed then I think inshallah we can we can assist in providing a venue but that has to be organized by the Islamic institutions not by the mass right and we can support them as much as we can okay and uh this is the last question I think it is important important to know that the AY emphasize that not just masida is only but the entire surrounding land Palestinian and Sham as attested to in the Quran that's see the suras is mentioning Surah is ay one Allah says that he has blessed this mosque the furthest mosque and its lands the prophet said may Allah bless our lant the whole Levant and our Yemen of course all of these are blessed land you know people that are are staying vigil are the people of Jerusalem and its surrounding areas so the prophet said go and visit Jerusalem and if you can't then send them oil you know send them kind of Supply so it's a Sunnah for us to Care and these are all blessed lands which is why this pains us it pains us to see ancient churches churches that have been there for from the first second third Century of the Christian era being destroyed it pains us to see children uh parents burying their children it's it's it's it's very painful to see this in a land that is supposed to be blessed in a land that has always been a home for all of these religious communities together for centuries for over a millennia it's painful the third oldest church in the world has been severely damaged in last week that's a good example uh when we talk to our Christian colleagues and that's another thing by the way we don't want to forget our our Christian brothers and sisters our Palestinian Christian brothers and sisters the patriarch of Jerusalem the the Christian communities in GZA there are a very important part of the story as well because they're not Muslims so this is not a Muslim and Jewish thing they're completely Palestinian and they're equally being targeted you know by this there's no Hames in the church Hamas are Muslims you know these are Christians and here just a just a couple miles away from here uh is uh Pastor STI and he's Palestinian um and he's you know and he's a pastor of his congregation you know of people from all different backgrounds so we should recognize that you know Palestinians are are both Muslim and Christian and it affects both one time said Hussein n told us this story in class he said a an American Christian Missionary went to the Holy Land to do missionary work so he went to a house and he knocked on the door and he opened the door and he saw a crucifix and he saw a picture of Christ and a picture of Mary and he's like how did you find out about the good word and the man said the man himself and he shut the door in his face you know see these are Christians that have been from the the time of Christians in this land and you know this is an American thinking that he's going to tell them about Christianity so these are Ancient Ancient Christian communities you ancient older than Islam in the land so I think that wraps up all the questions one thing uh you know just to leave you with something uplifting something positive don't be overwhelmed by all the negativity every hardship and every difficulty there is Victory there is assistance from Allah that comes with it you know Allah mentions the so he sends it twice so how is it possible that one difficulty and one hardship would not be overcome by two eases so Allah subhah tala he provides his assistant he says that don't be depressed don't be down and don't grieve if you truly believe then in the end you will be Supreme so you know when we when we we should also be cautious and not overwhelming ourselves with images because what ends up happening is if you become emotionally overwhelmed then you become you become Frozen then you're not able to be productive in your personal lives in your professional lives and then you won't be able to do anything for the people of RZA it's more important for you to you know do allocate a time in the day when you check the news and then in the evening just shut down and separate yourself from the news in order so that you can emotionally digest all of that um and then start the day fresh the next day and understand that life continues despite all of the hardship and Allah subh make it easy for the people [Music] [Music] m
