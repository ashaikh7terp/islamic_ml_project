so welcome everyone to this our monthly q a i have a list of questions so as is my habit i will go through these questions first and then uh and then if there are any other additional questions please use the chat function to bring them the first question is is kat belketeb considered any car if so is it followed by a second nikkah with the written contract please expound etc also if this practice is based on the sun of the prophet salallahu could you expand on the historical reference in islam is governed by contract law because marriage is a contract it is an offer for marriage based on certain conditions and accepting that offer so as long as there is the offer as long as there are the witnesses as long as there is the guardian the wali as long as there is the of course there are different opinions about each of those components but let's just for a moment assume we're looking at all of them as long as we have those conditions there is an offer and the offer is accepted that's the marriage plain and simple it's very very simple we tend to complicate things by adding other layers other cultural layers of course the nikkei is followed by the walima the walima is a sunnah in which you invite people to a meal it's a form of celebrating the marriage it's a form of announcing the marriage of course in the marriage contract there are witnesses the point of the witnesses is the contract is not done in secret that the contract is done publicly but the walima is a form of you know announcing it to the community that's the basic marriage we unfortunately we have over complicated that by adding many different layers what is the problem with that this question this question is the proof of the problem of what we've done now we've gotten to the point that people don't know if the kitab is the the nikkei or the kitab is something is uh like in the arab culture in egyptian culture sometimes people call the nikkei engagement it's not an engagement it's marriage it's an islamic marriage uh it makes what was not permissible permissible with the contract so we need to understand what the islamic you know principles are i mean i'm happy to answer the question and we also need to temper our cultural you know manifestations and our cultural things not that all of the cultural things are on marriages or i'm not saying that they're wrong but we overdo it and we over complicate it everything that allah gives us is simple we as as benny and sen we tend to overcomplicate uh my husband will be camping no access to water we'll have to carry most of his drinking water and look for any other water sources can you kindly review how to do tayammum and also any other tips that would be helpful in terms of keeping prayer when camping he is a chef egg so regardless of the medhab if we have a situation in which we are in like the questioner says we're camping so we have limited amount of water obviously the water is going to be used for drinking and or cooking uh let us assume that that's all the water that we can carry it's meaning that there's no excess water for wudu and there's no you know access to a river or a stream or a lake or something like that so that's one of the conditions in which we would need to make the thai moon the taiwan is simply uh to tap the earth once with the with the hands and to wipe the face it's the same part of the face that we wipe during the wudu to tap it a second time and to wipe from the fingers to the elbow on the right hand the fingers to the elbow on the left hand uh in the manikin method the mataki understanding of the earth is a little bit more expen expensive so we use that usually we use this opinion we give this opinion to people to make life easier uh you can make the team on a stone uh so as long as you find a stone that's sort of in its natural environment which should be quite easy uh you would you you can perform the tam on that you can actually just carry that stone with you if they're traveling and they're camping of course they would have it depending on how long the journey is they would be able to combine and or shorten the prayers if they are considered traveling if they're not considered traveling you can take the shaffer opinion by combining the prayers and i think there's a question that will come later about the combining of the prayers now you probably also want to carry a compass with you so you'll be able to find the direction during the time of prayer if you're not used to being able to look at the sun and whatnot okay somebody asked a loaded question about the dejan the mahdi the destruction of the kaaba uh and jude jude you know all of these signs that come at the end of uh of the world now i i would like to reference people that we we uh i taught this course right before the quarantine right before the pandemic outbreak uh signs of the final hour uh it's on our youtube channel there should be a playlist either under my name or under that i think it's four or five episodes so i strongly urge the question and of course it's accessible for everyone but let me just summarize in general when the when gabriel came to rasulullah and he asked him about islam he also asked them at the end of the the hadith a fourth question he asked him about the signs of human he says what is the hour the prophet saw said the one asking knows no more than the one being asked for he said that explain to me or shed light on its signs so the signs of the final hour the signs of the end of time the signs at the end of the world however we phrase it is actually one-fourth of our religion usually we we learn about these things when we study akhida when we study theology but it is it's it can be its standalone subject matter basically the alimet that took this area and wrote about it they understood that there were small signs medium signs and large signs all of the small signs are signs that happened during the lifetime of rasulullah the medium signs are the signs that happened after that until there's a special event that happens which itself is the beginning of the major signs of the end of time what is this event this event is described in a hadith a very famous hadith that is narrated in sahih muslim it is called the or known as the hadith of tamim adari who is a famous sahabi radhillahuanu or like this creature figure that features in this lengthy hadith from whence came the name of the hadith some of the hadith that are long or like the hadith of gabriel that we just mentioned sometimes they take a name basically to make a long story short the prophet sasan was talking to the sahaba about yeoman the end of time the things that the questioner asked and he's and he said of course i'm paraphrasing oh you know if you don't believe me ask tamim adari tanima deri will verify what i'm saying he'll tell you a story and then tamima dari goes on to narrate a story that happened to him before he became muslim before the advent of the prophet salatu salam was a traitor he found himself on the sea he got lost at sea he was shipwrecked on an island on this island he met this weird person creature called the jasasa the one who speaks or gives stories the jason creature took him inside this fortress where there was a man that was shackled that looked very scary and very odd this man was the man was the the jed and the dejan asked him a daddy three questions he said tell me about the dates of the city of beissan are there still dates in the city of baisan beissen is a city as a palestinian village that was occupied by the israelis and now subsumed into the state of israel that no longer has any natural dates of its own tamim said yeah of course there are dates in base and we know we trade we get dates he's like and then that the jedi said oh it's not time for me to come out yet then he asked them a second question he said tell me about lake tiberias is there still water in lake tiberias he said there's still water lake tiberias so the gen said it's not time for me to come out then he asked them a third question he said tell me about zohan is a old name for the dead sea is there still water in einzor he said yes there's still he said oh it's not time for me to come out so based on this hadith they all meant to talk about the signs of end of time they said that these three items when beissen no longer has dates when lake tiberias is depleted either completely or partially which it is in decline it has been in decline for for several decades and the dead sea obviously declines rapidly because there's no natural life in it they said that when these three things happen this is when the the gel will come and because some of these three things have happened like there's no dates in beissen for example the ulamet agree that we are now entering into the major science so the questioner asked about the dajjal the mahdi the destruction of the kaaba juji mahjouz all of these are from the major signs so we have now entered into this part of history the point of the hadith is is that those are just signs it doesn't mean that there's something inherently wrong or bad there'd be no dates here or there being no water here it's not like our we need to go fill the lake up with water that's not the idea the prophet saws is teaching us that when this happens this will be a sign that something else will happen so people that study the signs of the end of time and whatnot they also need to be very careful that the signs are simply signed they're simply markers okay so uh minor major uh sorry minor middle major signs there's an introduction to the major signs we are now in that the question is that the the gen will come first that the jed is like a trickster he will start by saying these uh platitudes and these one-liners that everyone will know and disagree with you know god is love happiness is good all these general generic terms that no no no on its face value no one will deny any of that so he'll start to attract people uh and he will use a like a judeo-christian paradigm in his discourse so he will attract a lot of from the a lot of the people from the people of the book and unfortunately he will also attract a lot of muslims so he comes out of persia the persian area and he ends up in jerusalem or thereabouts and it's there that he starts to flip things he starts to manipulate the weather he starts to manipulate genetics one of the hadith says he'll call somebody says come come come in front of me and he'll do something and he'll show this person all of his lineage all of his uh past lineage and potential progeny you know this is something with dna or genetics or ai or i don't know something like that in which you so people be like oh that's amazing they'll be overcome by the awe of that that you know more people will follow him more people will follow him and then he will turn so it's he starts off using these one-liners that everyone kind of agrees to and please i'm grossly uh summarizing this i mean refer back to the five lectures that we had and to discuss them in great detail and then you'll start to flip and then he'll start to you know call people to to wrong and things like that it is at that point that the mahdi emerges his name is muhammad the son of abdullah his father is abdullah his name will be muhammad and he is from the line of imam hassan alaihissalam is the descendant of rasulullah he will emerge in medina people will seek him out he'll flee to mecca because he doesn't want anything to do with this everyone will go to mecca he'll come back to medina so these are some of the signs he looks like the prophet you know it's very handsome radiant etc the mahdi then will go out after everyone comes and all of uh you know the leadership structure and infrastructure of the muslim majority world will support him he will then you know take this as a sign that he is expected to do this another he doesn't seek it out there's no you know congress of electing the mahdi and then oh i want to be the man it doesn't work like that this is gives dominion to whom he wants and he takes it away from whom he wants so after all of these people and all of these muslim world leaders you know basically begging him to take on this mantle he will take on this charge he will challenge the the jed and there will be fighting and there'll be great laws of life but the the mahdi will not be able to overcome the the gen until christ returns so the questioner didn't ask about the second coming of christ but those three are linked that the jed the mahdi christ comes the dejan when he when he meets the the the jedi will simply evaporate the hadith says the way that salt evaporates in water he will dissolve he will he will simply go away as fast as he came so these are not necessarily except for the fight with the mahdi these are not necessarily these like you know global battles that you know sometimes people think will happen and things like that anyway will end up in medina he will die in medina he will be buried next to rasmu those are the only three of the major uh sorry he said after isa will come out uh yeah most likely are in the current area of armenia uh again the dam that we find in surat til kaff that dulharn builds the destruction of this dam indicates the sign that juju and will come out not that the dam is actually plugging like a hole in the wall and there are these like goblins inside the earth called yet it's just a sign it's when this happens when that structure crumbles or or ceases to exist or is uh uh you know falls into ruin that just like the prophet saw salam said those three signs of beisan the dates of basan et cetera when that happens the jewish people will come out there was an abbasid khalifa in the past who sent a group of to survey where um where is the said where is this dam that was built by rudi and they found it and they described it and dc describes it in his famous book of geography and the report that was given to the khalifa that it's in this current area of armenia they will come out due to some sort of economic trouble seeking food and water and it will actually be their descent upon the lake of tiberias or thereabouts that causes the complete depletion of the water of the of lake tiberias so those four uh the jail the mahdi the all of these we know the sequence of all of these things but these are not the only major signs unfortunately the destruction of the kaaba you know may allah protect us the raising of the quran no one will know the quran you know protect us nobody will be left on earth that says allah allah you know there be no believers in all of these you know unbelievable great signs we do not necessarily know the order of them or where they fall this is the best html that we have okay so that's just a that's just a summary i've already taken up more time than i wanted to on that but again please see our series on the subject on the youtube channel can we consume sparkling apple cider yes because there's no alcohol in it my question is about sadhaka what is sadaqa what are the rules of sadaqah the person who's getting it should they know that it is sadaqah can we just give the money or can we sacrifice goat sheep or any had an animal give the meat to the poor or can we give any household things of clothing and sadhaka sadaqah is charity open-ended there is no restriction to sadaqah neither is there a restriction that sadaqah is for muslims or for non-muslims is just charity anything in excess it's completely different than zakir zakah is a article of our sharia it's an obligation given certain conditions when we have excess wealth above a certain amount a year has passed we own the money completely then we give from this access to those categories that are mentioned in surat the muslims in those categories because it is a way of redistributing some of the excess wealth from those that are wealthy to those that are less fortunate as the prophet sallallahu alaihi is different sadaqah is just a form of bitter a form of piety allah over and over and over in the quran he commands us to do bitter he commands us to do a piety to help those that are poor those who are needy those who are traveling those who need assistance whether they be muslim or non-muslim whether they be from our family or not from our family that's sadhaka and you don't have to tell people i mean if you're going to give somebody who's less fortunate support they know that this is charity you don't have to say it to them to make them feel bad they already know that this is you're under no obligation to say that it could be you know considered a gift uh to them because we also don't want to break the the heart of the poor and we don't want to uh hurt their feelings or their emotions and we want to lift them up if allah has lifted us up we want to lift the people around us up so that's just open-ended okay i got an extremely lengthy question which is like almost two pages long i'm not going to read the whole thing about intoxicants and drugs so i read the question a couple of times so i can be able to summarize it and and for the person writing the question i apologize that i'm not going to be able to read the whole thing because it would take probably like 10 minutes but the bottom line is the questioner is basing the question on the permissibility of certain types of drugs based on our prohibition on alcohol you know we all know that there's a prohibition against alcohol but then the question is what are the prohibitions against drugs and he brings up many points related to cannabis also related to hallucinogenics like psychedelics pelosi lsd and mushrooms and other other types of related drugs citing that cannabis and certain psychedelics are used by people uh to help in trauma psd uh you know all sorts of things which is which is which is true that is the case so what does islam basically say about these type of drugs so to make this the situation easy there are three things that you have to understand number one the prophet sallallahu sallam forbade us from every intoxicant from everything that intoxicates that would be like alcohol because it intoxicates and is something that makes you high now there are different classes of drugs that have different effects but that hadith for us that's the first thing you have to keep in mind number two the prophet saws there is no harm and there is no reciprocal harm so if we are going to consume anything use anything ingest anything take anything we have to understand what potential harm it has and number three in general the sharia is extremely liberal when it comes to medicine and the use of medicine so i there's really there's no need for for all of this if uh psilocybin or mushrooms or cannabis or whatever if they are known to cure certain ailments which i know you know based on the stuff that i've read the little that i've read they do there's nothing wrong with that and they can be used in those cases i mean if you take uh like oxycodone and you know vicodin and that stuff is nasty that stuff is really really serious stuff but we take them as you know i was in surgery i took that for almost six months multiple times a day for six months because of the pain of the post-surgery so i had to take it but it's very potent it's very dangerous it can be addictive but it's something that is becomes one of the principles of the sharia situations of necessity make the impermissible permissible so if it were regulated if there was some literature about it to document how they can help what kind of disorders or ailments they can correct and how they can correct them then by all means and on a sudden we would use them and we would be no prohibition whatsoever the problem with things like cannabis and psychedelics is that the people that consume them are very very convinced and very very biased at the efficacy and the need of those those substances and that type of while they bring up many good points the problem is that it's biased and it's not it's not the sharia approach so she needs to look at it scientifically you know what scientifically of course if you smoke up or if you trip acid of course people feel good and they go on trips and they feel different and my mind's expelled of course they all say that there's no doubt about that uh that's not the that's not the proof that we need the proof that we need is some sort of organized scientific study that helps us understand what exactly is happening what are the potential risks then it needs to be regulated what the questioner doesn't mention is that people who take psychedelics and things like that they need to take them under the care of of somebody you know they go to south america and they have like a shaman or somebody with them uh why because you're not yourself you can you know you you're you're tripping you're you're going you're somewhere else you who know you could throw yourself off a cliff for all you know because you're not in your right set of mind you are you are under the influence of that intoxication which its default ruling is that that's haram for the sake of it just to do it that's haram so for us to say okay it's doable or people can micro dose or people can use certain substances we need to be much more scientific about it they can use certain substances for what when we talk about cannabis are we talking about cbd or we're talking about the thc component the thc component is a psychoactive component what are the benefits of that there's there are people that talk about the benefits of cbd but to be honest it's it's almost it's very weak it's the thc that's potent where the real research needs to happen there are you know many people that we uh soldiers that suffer from post traumatic stress disorder uh great trauma that uh either turn to cannabis or different types of psychedelics who have been cured of that that's great allah created these things for us for us to use but to use them in a certain way the way that the moderate the the dominant culture that's pushing cannabis and psychedelics that's not the way we would do it we would go we we have no problem with researching it and looking at it but we would look at it in a different way the other thing that the question brings up which is also important are other substances like caffeine sugar and things like that caffeine doesn't intoxicate you it doesn't take you out of your mental state it gives you a bolt of energy if that energy is too great it could be haram so again it's it's not a blanket statement but but caffeine on its own is not haram and the alameda have written about coffee and you know all of that you know coffee is essentially a muslim drink it's a drink that islam gave the world and it gives a certain amount of energy sugar again anything in excess is going to be haram and there are certain people under certain situations under certain health conditions that can't have any sugar and shouldn't have any sugar so again but the effects of something like caffeine and sugar are not like the effects of cannabis or alcohol or psychedelics and the like um okay i mean i don't think i covered every single sentence but that's more or less what the questioner wanted to ask one thing he does say towards the end is that a lot of people i'm assuming muslims that talk about these things uh talk about them with misinformation and lack of education and i agree uh one of the things that we are taught is to give an islamic ruling a sharia ruling on something you must first be able to conceptualize the issue completely and understand it this is something that i have looked into i mean i'm not you know the world expert mushrooms but but i have looked into it a little bit and talked to people and done some research uh to know enough that we need more research is what i'm saying so please remember those initial principles most importantly that the sharia is very liberal when it comes to medicine because in the shafi medha for example even if the medicine contains an unpure substance you are allowed to consume it for medical purposes so the share is very liberal about that if it is you know needed and if it is safe and there are no long-term negative effects and what not but my point is that let us undergo the research maturely and scientifically to determine what is in and what is out okay can you please shed light on the practices of the prophet saws the sahaba during warfare of treating persons of prisoners and civilians i was impressed by your mentioning of hamas relative killing of civilians not being justified yeah we are not allowed to kill civilians i mean i can't even believe i have to say that that's abc of islam civilians is something that is completely forbidden by the prophet in our rules of engagement our rules of engagement are very difficult they're so difficult that one can almost conclude that it's almost impossible to have warfare like that in the modern world because of the conditions you can't destroy parts of the environment so you know you talk about smart weapons i mean they got to be like genius weapons because you can't just you know bomb something and oh well there's collateral damage the shadia would see that as haram uh women children elderly people people that are clergy uh or or or the like of established religions these are people that are non-combatants we're not allowed to target them we're not allowed to harm hospitals schools and the like the thing about israel and palestine and you know people get mad you know about this is that the majority of the muslim world has recognized not all but has recognized the state of israel the state of israel is a recognized nation that's why this idea when israelis come and say oh israel has the right to exist in them that's like a non-logical statement it exists already it exists and there are peace treaties and ties and there's an israeli embassy in cairo and i'm men and diplomat and vice versa i've seen i've driven by used to drive above daily the israeli embassy in cairo you see the israeli flag in the balcony of the of the embassy uh that means that we reckon that means that that guy that ambassador his staff his family in egypt have been given safe passage to be in egypt that means it will be haram to harm them just like it would be haram to harm the italian ambassador and his family because they have been given a man when their passports have been stamped they've been allowed to come in the shirt recognizes these things so just because i say that the the majority or many muslim majority countries recognize the state of israel that doesn't justify the occupation it doesn't justify israeli aggression it doesn't justify uh or it doesn't mean that we like it or it's just a reality it's a political reality therefore based on that reality there are going to be some implicit implications like this therefore if somebody came and asked me are there people israeli citizens that the sharia sees as civilians yes of course because of the reasons that i just mentioned that does not mean that we negate the right of the palestinian people or that the west bank is occupied east jerusalem is the capital of uh of palestine you know et cetera et cetera et cetera i mean that's not the point of the question but because you're you're using as an anchor what i said the other week about civilians anyway more to the point about treating of prisoners and civil we talked about civilians prisoners of war have to be fed have to be attended to medically uh have to all of the type of things you would find in the geneva conventions of you know and similar modern language the shitty i would uphold when it comes to prisoners in addition the prophet salallahu himself personally had his own way of dealing with the prisoners is that when he captured prisoners he used the skills that those prisoners had to improve the status of the sahaba and by doing that they earned their freedom and they were sent back you know home and i hear i'm referring to the prophet saws i'm using the prisoners of quraish to teach the sahabah to read and write so when he had the quraishis as prisoners those that could read and write he said if you teach x number of sahabas to read and write you you've earned your freedom and you can and you can go back so the prophet saws went even beyond the regular sharia conditions of care and humanitarian rights towards the prisoners of war torture is absolutely haram there's i mean it's so obvious it's one of those things that's funny that you even have to say torturous haram uh depriving them of food lights medicine air sunlight you know all of those type of things that is can we combine us all the time even when we are at home make it easy for us not to get lazy you can according to the opinion that i have been teaching all of you uh because it is a sound opinion that is in the shafi method and in this country we are a minority this is not a muslim majority country which means that the influence and this country is actually very large unlike other european countries where you know if you've ever been to a place like london um or well i only know london that well you know sometimes when you're in london you think you're in a muslim country or a muslim city it's easy to find a mosque but america's and canada is a little bit different because everything is so far away some people oh yeah i go to such and such mosque and it's you know 20 miles away that's those are long distances so because of the distances and uh there's no place you know to make wudu and now you know in light with covet and those type of health restrictions but we need this kind of opinion that's why these kind of opinions exist it's just for people like us so for us specifically living in north america there's nothing wrong with continuing to do that to combine the horrendous in either time in either time and insha allah this is not a form of laziness but rather this is a form of com compatibility with the sunnah of the prophet salam because this is what he did in medina as is reported in the hadith [Music] and found in the collection of sahih muslim how are we doing on time okay uh mine no there doesn't have to be a reason so the normal ruling is that there has to be a reason like we're in the mosque now if it started raining heavily then when we prayed we would combine with it because of the rain or if i'm sick but this opinion there's no it's for no reason specifically that's the wording of the hadith that the prophet saws in medina for no reason and it is an odd opinion it is a unique hadith and many of the other imams did not take from this hadith and did not agree with it but imam and shafi especially the later chaplains they agreed with it now you know the hikmah why because of people like us because this situation exists in which we need to we might need to follow now i'm not saying you have to follow this position if you don't want to follow it that's that's fine uh when i'm at home i don't follow it you know i don't feel the need but if you follow it you should don't feel bad or any shame or you're not being lazy in your deen you are your prayers are accepted in shock shia combine yes uh all the time in this way correct because they see us as one time one time slot in which you have to perform the two prayers rather than the way we see it as two separate time slots nothing no they pray together pray together my 19 year old daughter i think i feel i got this question last time we'll answer anyway my 19 year old daughter um wants to know why and where in the foreign does the order come to eat the biha she eats only the bias and she was 14 but then got diagnosed with celiac 16. she cannot have gluten anymore when she is with her school on tournaments and can't find halal or gluten-free then at times she has to just have milkshakes for dinner she is still only eating and now old enough to figure out her way but wants to be sure and knows what to do okay the issue of of the the biha food is that we are not allowed to eat something that is killed we are forbidden from eating that which is not slaughter uh of course pig products and that which is slaughtered for other than allah which means that we have to slaughter the animal to to eat so then the question is is that the meat that we that we find in the local market is it the biha meaning is it slaughtered or is it not slaughtered this is where the issue comes from the quran is very clear we're not allowed to eat meat that is not slaughtered this is where the issue comes from of your daughter wanting to know what does the quran say as far as the testament as far as saying allah's name over the slaughtered animal there's a difference of opinion amongst most of them say that you have to do the testament but in the sha'a mat if you don't it's considered a sunnah so if you if you look at the wide sharia as long as the animal is slaughtered then it's fine and it's permissible for us to eat we are also allowed to eat the food that is slaughtered by the people of the book specifically the jews and the christians so in our case living here kosher anything that is kosher would be well not anything that's kosher but meat and poultry that is kosher would be permissible for us to eat there is another opinion a weaker opinion that exists within the maliki method that would allow us to consume you know meat and chicken in this country if it would be considered the food of adul kitab i caution against following that opinion as i've mentioned over many times before because there is another component to eating halal food which is that it affects our spiritual or our our relationship with allah subhana so the prophet saw he said eat that which is what is answer your prayer meaning that if you don't eat what is halal then that can like clog up your relationship so in the case of you know let's say your daughter when she was a teenager in the past and she was going to these you know diners and because she has celiac disease you know that would be an appropriate uh situation in which she could follow that weaker position because of the great hardship she's only going to follow once or twice while she's on the road with the team and that's it that's okay but i would not go i would not make it a habit to follow this opinion uh i mean i don't follow that opinion at all because in the area in which we live we have enough access to highland food we also have enough access to kosher foods uh there are even you know main main grocery chains uh so it should be we can also just eat fish or or some type of other fish option if we're out in about one month so i would i would take eating or the series this is not like a cultural thing there is a great impact for it but also know that we have flexibility in times of need okay now you clarify that during one does not need to remove their socks if one had kept their socks on since the last will do does the same rule apply to women's head scarf no because you have to wipe the head so the woman would need to remove the scarf or she could put her hand underneath the scarf and wipe her head but you couldn't wipe over the scarf in lieu of wiping that and then right before i came there was a question about abortion what is the ruling on abortion islam allows abortion if needed up until the first four months because of the hadith that at 120 days this is when the soul is is placed into the body so the sharia differentiates between the vegetative state of the the initial what is it or whatever it's called i forget the name and then once the soul is breathed placed in the body then it is considered you know a human being in cases post 120 days an abortion can only take place if there's a dire need and it can only take place if the the physician and like the mufti consult so that's like a case by case you know if there's a great grave situation to the mother you know and there are situations like that but before 120 days it can be allowed but even when i say that it's also not to be taken lightly because you know obviously it's it's a serious act but it is permissible okay let's see if this works uh okay somebody put the link to the signs of the end of time great it was very eerie because we were doing that as things were closing and i think the last class i was just sitting here all by myself just like looking into the i'm like this is the end that was very weird anyway but i encourage people to read it i encourage people to watch them uh because we go through the what i the little sketch that i just gave tonight i gave more detail to it what is the proper way to dispose of dead animals birds in your yard you can just bury them that's that's fine oh that's the same question twice all right are there any other questions i think we have like maybe 10 minutes or not not over she would have to you know place her hand like this you know just end like that there's a shorter version and a longer version when is it permissible it's a shorter version sometimes in juma the the shorter version is the tashahud that we say in the second raqqa uh of uh and that's the first part of the teshahud up until the shahedah of any prayer we continue after that the prayer on the prophet so that's the difference between when we say it and how we do it sometimes during taraweeh and even tomorrow the mom finishes very quickly no i think maybe he's just rushing yeah but after the when you're sitting in the final tasha even if the imam finishes the prayer and does his salam you can continue even if it's for moments you don't have to finish exactly at the same time so if you know and maybe that's a message for me sometimes maybe i'm too fast but you can continue the other question i have is the day of juma because the quran says you need to pray and rush back to work right so so the question about the drama prayer and surat al-juma saying that after we pray we can go back to work basically droma is a ritual that can take us from federer of friday up until the jummah time uh you know ideally one would obviously wake up and pray fajr and then take a bath and then arrive to the mosque early you know it's an opportunity to come and you know i mean obviously this is x-ray you don't have to do this but then after you finish the drama prayer that's when you can resume your your business life is what allah is saying in other words it's not the sabbath where you have to take the whole day off nor either either what i said you can open your shop in the morning and work in the morning or see your clients in the morning and just break for drama which is what most people in the west do they come to the mosque to pray okay then you can go back and it's a way of emphasizing that juma is not the muslim sabbath in other words it's not a day where you have to rest or have to take off you're allowed to go back there's nothing wrong or haram or immoral with finishing the your obligation towards allah and then going back but allah says as you go back remember allah often remember allah often so for us our way is that we we can be in this world but not of this world so we can work and still remember allah it's not either or and ibn arabic he says in the future he says the strangest thing i said i saw when i was in mecca is i saw an old man hanging by the the curtain of the kaaba crying and pleading with allah for dunya and when i was in the marketplace i saw a young man who was trading but his tongue was constantly remembering allah so that that's like a story that i always like to share because that young man that's our motto you can you can be in business and do your work there's nothing wrong with that but your heart can be with allah that one does not preclude the other any truth to killing an insect break will do no please repeat brother muslin's question sorry i i just did i'm sorry can one stay in sujood longer too in jamaal [Music] uh like not too long throughout the prayer or else you'll lag behind you can't lag behind too long more than two major motions in the end and the last you you can because there's no more prayer after that the imam is going to do the to shout and do the teslim you can still be in sujood when the amen is saying and your your prayer will be fine so at the end that's fine but try not to make it a habit oops i lost a question try not to make it a habit throughout the prayer remember the the prophet saws that you follow him that's why we have the imam of the prayer so we follow the person leading the prayer well there's quite a quite a few of you online it would have been nice to see everyone i missed it um can you please expand on why you can make wudu over the socks but not the hijab provided both were put on when you have the dispensation for the wiping over the sock the hoof comes from the hadith so it's that's there's a clear text about that we can't wipe over any other article of clothing except the sock now the head there are different opinions in the different madame of how much of the head needs to be wiped the shafai madhhab is the most liberal the chef i say only three hairs so if for example i have my my turban on i could just go like this and and wipe like that and then that's enough no i didn't want to get into that but since april brought it up i gotta get into it so that's the way that the a woman can like say you're out and you have hijab and you're out and out and about uh just do that just put your fingers up and at least grab three hairs as long as your fingers are wet and they touch the three hairs then for the as i uh according to imam shafa you have i was trying to be more universal but okay so that's that will make it easy take advantage of practice yeah or men too yeah so let's say let's say you know like me i have my hat on and i don't know where am i going to put it or or a woman and she has her hijab so when you come to wiping your head if you just tilt it back and grab three hairs then that's it then that's enough is there a quick response to how the shia derived to combine um i i can't remember the verse right now but it has to do with the verse about they see the prayer time of the day or the one period of time in which to pray i mean it's there's textual evidence for that it's not like they just made it up but the hadith the verse escapes next time inshallah and siblings own brothers and sisters stand next to each other and pray i mean boys with the boys and the girls with the girls that they can pray side by side if there's a gap between them or the boys in the front and the girls in the back but not boy girl boy girl are there is there a reason why two lambs are required for a boys and one for a girl child well it's not required it's just a sudden and this is just because of the text of the hadith there's no rational understanding that i know of that of that ruling you can certainly slaughter more for example but there's the hadith talks about the two and the one how are we doing on time what time is uh okay so we just have a few more minutes left some argue that pre-marital sex is allowed in committed relationships as marriage early during islam was a quicker ordeal is this valid there is no there is not one article or particle of truth in this sentence whoever wrote this some argue that pre-marital sex is allowed zina is is one of the major sins is one of the quebec it's it's one of the necessarily known things in islam it has nothing to do with in the past and in the future and the the marriage contract allows what was haram to be halal which is the sexual act as long as there's that offer and the the offer and the accepting of the offer based on the conditions literally that can take three minutes two minutes there can't be anything easier than that so unless that happens there can be no sexual act then that is considered haram uh so there's no such thing as a committed relationship these are all modern terms there's no committed relationship either you're married or you're not married or somebody is your relative that's it doesn't it doesn't matter we're going steady we're on second base we're in third base we're committed those are all modern terms that does nothing to do with the sharia that's nothing to do with the quran and the sunnah i don't know ask the question i'm just saying you know if somebody's confused or something like that just let me lay it you know clean for you guys marriage has to happen for the sexual act to be permissible that's the whole point of the marriage act and that's why we celebrate it and you know because it's like the beginning of the family related to that is lineage related to the lineage is going to be matters of inheritance and matter of who you're related to and who you're not related to all sorts of societal issues stem from you know society is built from marriage uh and um it's why we feel we have a home you know what what do we say what makes a home where our parents are buried what is this what does a song say land where my fa pilgrims pride land with my father's died let freedom ring right we even in america we say that that matters where your parents are buried or your grandparents are buried if you don't have that type of relationship you're not going to have any uh patriotism or love of protecting your home where does that all come from it all comes from marriage and i mean this sounds old-fashioned but it doesn't mean that it's wrong and from the marriage comes children and from children come society so on and so forth and that's why islam puts so it's such an important thing not just for muslims but for all all religions so the marriage contract for us is the vehicle is the instrument that allows that act to take place before that there is that act would be considered illicit okay speak now forever ultra peace this is this is the final we're in the final stretch now the rational being that allah wants us to congregate as opposed to brain individuals yes so the one of the one of the reasons behind the legislation of juma is that it it's it's a way for us to congregate to be together and for us to hear something of benefit because when you pray on your own you might not have that that dose of you know somebody reminding you of something so instead of praying the photo i mean we could have prayed the four rakahs together that could have been jummah but no allah also made took away two raka's and gave us the hudba in lieu of those two raka's so that we can hear something which is why the role of the khatib it's so important that the you know has a tall task you know tall order which is to say something to motivate people to to you know admonish them to remind them and so on and so one of the wisdoms behind the jummah prayer is that we congregate that's one so we can come together as a community and number two is that we can also listen to something that is of benefit once you get that dose allah says okay you can go back and you can you can do go back to your trading can you expand on how many candidates one can speak to at a time when considering marriage well until there is a agreement that you guys are going to get married you're searching so you can speak but once there is some kind of commitment verbal and that and different cultures do it differently sometimes people are like oh do you know let's recite the fattah together and we all recite the fatah halas that means that there is that you are now taking the steps that's the engagement you are now taking the steps towards marriage you know you're not going to go talk to somebody else so communication is very important and and because these things are very sensitive and because as parents we always want what's best for our kids sometimes we mess up by not communicating so all of the problems can be mitigated by just very clear communication uh let me think about it it's very different than masha'allah let's recite the fattah right inside the fatiha that means we're beginning something together so until there is that type of commitment that we are going to begin the process you can talk and you can entertain uh suitors and whatnot after that commitment then you got to see that commitment through either inshallah to success or it just doesn't work out and then you part ways we'll see you guys friday show say hi come on you
