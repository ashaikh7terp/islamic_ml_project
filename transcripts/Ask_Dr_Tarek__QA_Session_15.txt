so i received many many questions actually i received some questions as soon as just a couple hours ago to the point that i couldn't print them so i have to read the first a few from the phone the first question the effectiveness of prayers for the dead of the gravesite versus from elsewhere is a physical onsite visit to the grave of a loved one more effective than a virtual prayer if souls are not physically bound to their graves does it matter where we pray for example if one's in a different country and unable to visit family graves the thought is allah would accept our prayer from ever we are please explain further so it is whatever we do on behalf of the deceased whether it be making dua for them reciting the fatah for them reciting quran for them etc etc wherever we are that reward will go to them and they will benefit from it going to the grave itself that's for us the prophet sallallahu alaihi said you know go to the graves visit the graves because it will remind you of the remind you of death so the the the distance when it comes to these matters is not important the prophet sasalam for example says you said that whoever sends their salam on me i receive it and i respond that sallam wherever wherever they are but going to visit rasulullah that's for us the living you know so we feel that closeness etc so uh no wherever the distance is you can say the dua and insha allah will will benefit them second question the awareness of souls when we visit their grave sites our souls are aware where we are visiting their graves i greet everyone when i visit a sibling's grave locally uh we're supposed to do that i believe but if souls are not physically in their graves do they know we are visiting you know that is this that is the place of the of the of the soul uh but the soul is not tethered uh as heavily to the body as it is during our lifetime uh and when you go to visit a loved one or anyone for that matter they hear and they are aware of your visiting uh in the hadith after the battle of bed the prophet sasalam you know went to the graves of the his enemies vanquished and he spoke to the graves and he said did you find you know what allah god's promised to be true for and i found god's promise to be true he kept going by grave grave by grave and the sahaba said you know ya rasulullah what do you say they're dead they don't hear he said no they hear just like you here but they cannot respond and this was for the kuffar of quraysh so of course this applies to the believers as well allah's acceptance and answers to our prayer and trying to explain the nuances of his answer especially the ways in which he answers i don't think i clarified well enough explaining this to someone i welcome your thoughts on acceptance and answers both and allah subhanahu wa ta'ala hears all of our prayers all of our dua that is a form of allah answering because it is rewarded so the act of dua itself is a reward the prophet sallallahu alaihi he said and in another another narration that dua is worship the the the act of calling out and asking allah that is the fundamental quintessential component of all of our acts of worship because it acknowledges our need and that only allah can fulfill that need so that itself is a kurba the act of asking is is a devotional act itself but i want something specific allah can choose to answer that or not to answer that or to answer it in a different way or to prolong me getting it or to give me another version of it or to block this so that something else may happen i mean there are all of these permutations that can happen so insha'allah our our dua is our answer first of all our duas are heard and they are rewarded and insha allah they are answered but we do not know ultimately where the is and that's the point of being patient and that's the point of being content is that we do not know exactly where the is and what we have asked but we always have a good opinion of allah salawat and non-ramadan fasting my aunt was discouraged saying salawat while walking i am surprised please illuminate no the the salawat on the prophet sallam is accepted universally even from a non-believer because if a non-believer would say allah muhammad for example you know allah send your prayers and salutations on satan muhammad allah will despite their disbelief send his salutations on the prophet sallallahu alaihi so this is a a universal purba there is no limit to it there are no boundaries to it there is no limit to the extent of our devotional practices towards the prophet saw asylum or our love of the prophet sasan or our praise of the prophet sasan you know there's nothing that can stop that because there is nothing greater in the created world greater than satan muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam says in the in the burden he is the beloved whose intercession is sought against all of the calamities that we face in this world and in the next so there are no limits to salawat on the prophet saw at all um what are the best days of the week to fast monday or end or thursday the prophet saws fasted as a sunnah fast mondays and thursdays he was specifically asked about his fast on monday and he said on monday this is a day in which i was born so it's as if the prophet sasalam celebrated his birthday every week by fasting on monday as an act of devotion of allah so mondays and thursdays are sunnah fasts there's also hadith to talk about fasting the middle days of the lunar month the 13th the 14th and the 15th of every lunar month those are also soon the days to fast but that being the case i would not i would encourage people if fasting is difficult if it's a difficult task when you feel the desire to fast just fast don't don't say oh i'm gonna wait to do it the day after tomorrow because it's an optimal door don't do that just don't let anything prevent you from committing to the to the devotional act if you're you know a regular faster and you just you're asking because you want to adjust you know mondays and thursdays and or the three middle days of the month of course then there are the occasional fasts there's the fast of ashura the tenth of maharam which is you know highly recommended at one point it was a ford for the muslims to fast before the obligation of ramadan and then there is the fast there is no real strong hadith on the fast of the month of rajab i think has a book about the hadith that are narrated in the fast of rajab and i don't think any of those are necessarily strong but at the end of rajab to commemorate the israel maharaja one confessed and certainly nis for sha'ben which will be upon us soon the 15th of shaaban the night before is a blessed night for dua plus the day of the 15th of shabban is the fast the prophet saws didn't fast in any month more than he fasted in the month of uh outside of ramadan in the month of sha'an as the  states and then the first nine days of the hijjah particularly the ninth the day of arafah the day before the hajj so these are some of the also this occasional sunnah fast can women do at the cafe during ramadan at the mosque if there is a separate section yes inshallah can we ask an idol worshiper such as a buddhist or a hindu to make dua for us i mean i wouldn't state that i wouldn't state it that way um you know think well of me pray for me is sort of like a almost like an expression now that doesn't necessarily mean make dua for me uh but there's no there's no harm in being cordial with them but i wouldn't necessarily ask you know for prayers okay now to my my list of questions in a typical average of one hour window between fajr and sunrise till when can you still pray before it is considered makru the prayer time of fajr begins with what is called astronomical dawn which is a you know very technical term and as it's called in the books of the true dawn and it lasts until the disk of the sun begins its ascent on the horizon the minute that the disc of the sun is seen that is the sharok which means before the disc rises in the horizon the rays of the sun are still illuminating the you know the horizon so there is some light out so if you prayed for example at towards the end of fedra like in summer time when fajr is so early many of us pray towards the end of the fajr time it will seem like there's still some light out the makru time is to wait till the very end of the prayer time but having enough time to to to say to pray both both raka's so you have to look at the at the schedule to see what the time is the time of any prayer is delaying the prayer unnecessarily towards the end of the time of prayer the best time to pray is obviously the beginning time i mean there are different opinions about that across them and they have a generally speaking when the then comes is that is the best time to pray the obligation as a habit prophet muhammad saw some heart was taken out and washed with zem zem before during the maharaja how many more times his heart was washed with zimzem and was there any scar in his chest the prophet sasam's heart was washed uh the first time when he was a child uh with haleem and then a second time when the prophet saw sallam received the revelation on the night of laylatul the night of icarus and a third time as the question states in the israel maharaja and some debate whether it happened a fourth time or not and the sahaba who described the physical appearance of the prophet they did say that they saw a scar that you know that went you know basically towards the left side of his chest down to his navel you know as a straight line there was a physical scar that was seen by the sahaba around him i was going to the masjid for one of the prayers i got pricked in my thumb and it bled a little do i have to make wudu again no there are there is something called excusable amounts of filth so the the dinar the coin the gold coin which is a little smaller than an american quarter if you have less than a dinars you know like that less than a dinar's amount of negessa of ritual impurity blood or urine or something like that on your body or clothes while you're praying it's it's excusable um so if you were you prayed and then you finished the prayer and you looked down and you know there's a little nick here or nick here that's okay that that doesn't invalidate the prayer nor do you have to necessarily pray again or make will do again are shias considered muslim i have heard that they believe that sunnis have taken verses out of the quran and they believe that the twelve men govern the world alongside allah is this true no the shias are muslim anybody who faces the qibla and anyone who says the shahada is a muslim uh that is the the definition so the definition of muslim is very wide and all of the sects uh that we know of are we consider them muslim unless and until something appears from them that violates the those like basic you know things now the difference the differences between the sunnis and the shia are are many but most of those differences can be reconciled as differences of interpretation or differences of opinion however there are five issues between us and the shia which are substantial and it is the discussion or the reconciliation between the people of sunnah and the people of tashaya are on those five issues the first issue is as the questioner said the infallibility the isma of the twelve imams the twelve imams are also are universally accepted as imams i mean the sunnis have the same love for the family of the prophet alaihis the shia and we honor and we revere the the 12 imams the descendants of of say the fatima and but they say or or some of their works say that they are infallible we do not believe in any infallibility after the prophet sallallahu they are a source of uh establishing legislation and that is only for rasulullah now we believe that those 12 images are saintly and are protected and are pure and are wise and and and many of them were all met of the outer and the inner et cetera et cetera but that doesn't mean that we would say that they are uh they are infallible but they are at the same level as all companions going down because there is no infallibility after the prophet sallallahu alaihi the second issue is the issue of the cursing of the sahaba there is a literature in in the the world of shia islam uh horrible literature of the cursing of the sahaba the sahaba that fought in the great fitna between imam ali alaihissalam and said there is a literature and a tradition of cursing those sahabah now i mean cursing the sahaba is is an enormity beyond you know one ones one even shutters just to think of the thought say from the mothers of the believers from the text of the quran the quran is the quran making a mistake therefore i mean it it brings up so many theological problems um you believe we believe that imam ali was right by the way and imam and said i was wrong and by the way a lot of the narrations and a lot of the details of the stories that happen of the fitna between imam ali are wrong and forged and incorrect by the way you know on that issue so that's the second issue the third issue as the questioner mentioned is tahrir quran is it some in the shia literature say that there is uh parts of the quran or that have been changed or that have been altered uh and even there's a a well-known book by one b how i remember the shortened version anyway there is a tradition that they believe that the quran has been corrupted etcetera etcetera cetera of course we believe in that one of the miracles of the quran is that has been protected and preserved and there is no evidence to the contrary the fourth issue is a theological issue uh al-bada which is a theological issue that means as we understand it that god changes his mind which is a huge theological problem we do not believe that allah changes his mind and the fifth issue is the issue of the tokyo or of you know hiding what one believes in etc now these five issues of course the shia have responded to i i mean i'm just stating the problem as it exists from our perspective but for the last almost 100 years 80 80 years plus this reconciliation between the sunnis and shias has emerged and the major maharaja and ayatul laws of of the world of tasha have responded and now this is not what this means and no this is not what this means we condemn those that that curse the sahaba etc and that it's upon that those responses that this reconciliation has taken place but yes those traditions do exist and because those problems are so enormous in the scale unfortunately the burden is on the people of tishaia to make a better effort to to clarify their position on those on those issues to say to say that the sahaba to curse the sahaba is essentially to curse the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam i mean to even think about that because the the definition of the sahabah are the people that the prophet sasan saw the prophet sasan dealt with they are his companions so did he make a mistake or did he fail in his mission i mean all of these theological questions happened that obviously no that would dismantle our belief altogether so there are enormous issues but they have been reconciled so the upshot or to go back to the original question is no we we we hold the shia to be our brothers and and sisters in faith we consider the muslims of course there are different types of shia the zaydi shia of yemen which is a form of seven imam shiism are closer to the people of sunnah they're very close to the hanafi manhattan for example and then the larger group of the people of tashaya are the ithna the jaffraya the the twelve imams shia the shia of uh of lebanon of iraq of iran etc and then the ismailis are another form of seven uh seven or people of the share and they claim that they follow jafari and the ismailis are also are subdivided into other groups so there are different sects but universally anyone who says the kalima mohammed rasulullah prays the five prayers towards mecca is a muslim must one read the rude for the dua to be accept for their dua to be accepted so what's the shortest durood now allah subhanahu ta'ala will accept anything insha allah our opinion of allah is is high but to put ourselves in an optimal state for us to offer the dua to be accepted we should send prayers on the prophet sasan before the dua and after the dua muhammadin is a short version that's that's easy they think it's important to say so our master muhammad and to remember the family of the prophet sallam because of their purity and because our love for and before our love of bait what are the salafis and what happens should we stay away from them the the self is a term that the muslims use to describe several things in one opinion the salaf are the first three generations the generation that grew up around the prophet saws on the sahaba the generation that grew up with them the te being the com the the the followers and then the generation that grew up with them that's the the narrowest definition the second definition that's a little bit larger is this is the first three centuries of islam and then the third definition which is even larger than that is that the end of the salaf the time of the salaf ends with the beginning uh the end of the fifth century so it would end with people like imam al-ghazali who died in 505 of the hijra imam and by haqqi who i believe died in 504 radiolog so it's a term that we use to refer to the earlier generation we are the khalaf we are those that have come after the year 500. a couple of centuries ago about 200 250 years ago there emerged this idea that the muslim world has become dilapidated has lost its way has uh ceased in power i mean which which is true it has ceased in power we've been occupied et cetera et cetera and therefore uh the error of our way the cause of our downfall is that we have strayed from the path of the seraph so we need to go back and revive that you know that type of islam so this is where the idea of the salafi thought or the salafi movement comes comes in and the problem with that is that what ends up happening is that people erase want to erase everything that's happened from the time of the salaf to our time and sort of cut it out as a time period take it and remove it and wants to put us here in you know 1443 and put us all the way back to the year 200 for example but that is not the way of of the ummah the ummah is it builds one generation over the other one generation receives from the generation before and passes on to the generation after it adding its commentary and and its understanding its wisdom its inherited wisdom that's what makes our civilization one of the greatest civilizations to have ever existed amongst humankind is that it is robust that is dealt with all of these permutations and historical instances and we have found nonetheless that our quran and sunnah to be equally valid now as it was at the time of the original revelation but the salafi concept is to erase all of that and to go back but salaf and the salaf as i mentioned in the beginning is a time period it's not a madhhab there's no medhab called the medhab of the self that term or concept never existed there is no hadith for example narrated uh by the seraph so and so the salafi who narrates on so and so the salafi that doesn't exist but i i carry a chain of transmission for example from me back to rasulullah or back to imam sheffie first and then from imam shafi to to rasulullah all narrated by shepherds so my teacher so and so the chef i said his teacher so-and-so he said his teacher showed the chef i said etc that that imam is said etc so the shepherd is a madhhab you have the you have the same hadith for maliki's for example or you have hadith that are transmitted by certain acts the hadith transmitted by laughing or the trans hadith transmitted by shaking the hand so on and so forth but there's no so there's no tradition there's no tradition that's narrated by the salafi it's not a it's not a movement it's not a concept it's not a method it's a time period that we revere and we honor the people of the past so the salafis that's sort of where it starts and from there you know kind of all hell breaks loose from there and then there are multiple multiple multiple permutations of this thought until our age now the wahhabis are one manifestation or one popular or well-known manifestation of that thought muhammad who emerged in the area of the arabian peninsula and also held these same views that there was this quote-unquote cult of saint worship the people were going to the graves and visiting the graves we need to demolish these graves we need to bring back tawheed and as a matter of fact muhammad would abdullah his own brother wrote against him and his own father kicked him out of his study circle and this was a person of great fitna and he aligned himself with the al-saud family in the beginning and they rebelled against uh the you know the ottoman controlled arabia uh in the east and then they they conquered the western part of arabia including jeddah mecca medina and united it all under one kingdom you know the saudi kingdom so that's a very specific thing that happens historically in that part of and gives rise to the modern kingdom of saudi arabia now this issue of of the the salafism i mean forget that we're heavy because that's something very specific but just the general concept as i've outlined it you can see that there are problems with that concept and it's inconsistent with our intellectual heritage and it's the cause of great fitness many of these questions that i get every month come from that mentality not that you have that mental but are you are influenced by that mentality it's sort of out there in the ether and we've inherited that and it's created great great atrocities uh and one of the permutations of it is that it it gives rise to extremism it gives rise to extreme muslim thinking and that extreme muslim thinking gives rise to violence against muslim states and violence against muslims and violence against muslim minorities this recent bombing in the shia mosque and i think it was in pakistan uh persecution of of of shia in sunni majority countries you know the the abuse of women uh so on and so forth it comes from it's born out of this concept we didn't have this problem before why because islam is inherited one generation after another one generation after another and then therefore we retain the wisdom of the past we retain the commentary of the past and then we build and we continue to build so that we can add wisdom and we can add experience to the generation after us but when you cut things out and have a selected view of your intellectual history then you're going to create all of these inconsistencies and that's unfortunately you know what we ask allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to heal this wound this is the great cancer that has befallen us this is the challenge that that we of today this is our challenge as muslims that we have that we need to fight against this uh this aberrant way of thinking and we have to revive once more the the glory of our intellectual history uh an understanding of both the letter and the spirit of the revelation of the for animals is it permissible to use hookah such as when at a restaurant that offers it the alamed differed uh on the their opinion towards tobacco use this tobacco something that emerged as a new thing as coffee did for example and there are all sorts of opinions from its permissible to its recommended to its macro to its haram etc the reality of the matter is that there are different types of tobacco use uh tobacco which is addictive such as cigarette tobacco uh addicted addictive that has addictive chemical components you know that stuff is all deemed haram because of its its established harm that it causes but there were many alame of the previous generation that smoked and that used tobacco uh and um those people would argue that it's makru so it's the the dominant opinion today or of the majority of fatwa uh bodies is that you know smoking is haram that's just sort of the default but there are other opinions i would say that it's disliked and it's makuu if it's something that's done occasionally and it's harm is minimized and managed in that way you know one could say that it is makuu obviously it's safest to stay away from it and not to develop the habit to start out with but that's sort of how i look at it because something like the hookah or shisha well you know what it's harm is bad and we should stay away from it let me just say that let's say it like that how should i select which meds have to follow my parents and family are hanafi i think i learned how to pray based off a video which i think follows the shafi method so i don't know which method to follow as i've said in the past about the issue of methods the math hab is a construct that is used for the student of sacred knowledge the person who is training to learn islamic law hopefully to one day teach that madhhab and to answer people's questions as the way i'm answering questions for example for you uh it's not necessarily a construct that is used by all muslims so there's a difference between the person who has engaged in the selective uh systematic study of islamic law you know it was as we say the taliban the student of sacred knowledge and the average muslim the average muslim has no mufti it has no madhhab their method is the madhhab of their mufti as we were taught meaning that your method is is what your imam tells you when you come and ask a question how do i do this or how should i do that that then becomes your opinion because there are multiple media there's not just one method over islamic history we've had over 80 of them and to be able to answer people's questions in the public square you need to be able to know how to choose from the different media how to be able to find opinions that are compatible for people's circumstances so on and so forth uh the person who teaches you the person who you ask that becomes your meth habit it's on them therefore the burdens on them if you want to study islamic law at a deeper level you have to study one of them and then one of the four methods because you can't study islamic law except by studying one method you have to study one system of legal thought and over the course of years of studying you end up learning about the other opinions and other media so on and so forth do the jinn have the ability to physically harm us or are they prevented from doing so by allah i think i recall hearing about how iblis took the form of a man and joined the war against the prophet sasan but ran away yes the jin can can physically harm us uh it is possible uh the harm is is easily repelled by the basic things that we do by keeping our wadu by making sure that we you know clean ourselves after the bathroom by making are saying our prayers by reciting and the last three surahs of the quran you know those basic protections ward us ward off that harm because allah says in the quran that the power and machinations of satan and his minions is weak it's weak whispering at you and then runs away they run away they're scared so yeah they're technically that can happen but not not at the level that people think it's not like some cinematic you know arch enemy that's going to bring about the destruction of humanity if anyone's going to bring about the destruction of humanity it's us you know not the jinn if some someone didn't watch janaba is their jummah prayer hallel the question is if somebody didn't is in a state of jennaba is their jummah prayer valid no the prayer is not valid it's invalid you have violated one of the conditions of the prayer which is to be in a state of tahara if you are in a state of jeneba then you have to do your host and then make up thoher prayer for rakaats because you missed jummah and if you didn't know then there's no sin involved but that's the correct procedure in that case islam believe in allah christians believe in jesus so my question is who what do the jewish people believe in all three of the the faith judaism christianity in islam they believe in allah as a as a bare minimum which is why they are considered the monotheistic religions along aside also with zoroastrianism which is a smaller unfortunately fading religion only maybe a few hundred thousand left probably at most today but the concept of that tawhid is different for the face so as we know the christians believe in the trinity or some version of the trinity which means many many different things for all of the many many many different sects of of christianity uh are they three separate entities are they related how are they related is christ also divine is christ not divine i mean there are and and the the christian the early christians fought wars with one another uh uh i mean you know if you read in in edward gibbons uh decline and fall of the roman empire i mean one one of his volumes i remember he talks about this problem and some of the some of the bloodshed is is unbelievably horrific i mean i've never i couldn't even believe that that stuff actually happened over these theological issues between christians on the meaning of the trinity so you know we have i'm not an expert or we have absolutely no time here to describe the differences but there is some version of the trinity the jews also are monotheistic they believe in god yahweh you know israel the famous hebrew prayer hear o israel your lord our god is one ahad you know so they are monotheistic but they they might have different ideas about what is permissible for god what is obligate obligatory for god we are pure monotheists and if you study islamic theology and you study the the science of tawheed or suladine or it has different names but it's the same subject you will learn that we have a very consistent very clear absolute pure monotheism so the problem or the the differences come in what do we mean by there's one god uh and there are many texts jewish texts for example that would allude almost to an anthropomorphic concept of god or we reject any any any concept of anthropomorphism for example but they're still muahedoon they're still you know monotheists catholics have saints muslims too have saints please clarify the saint in islam is the person who is has achieved a consistency in their worship and is the comma that they are always praying that they are always making the victory that they are aware that they have tamed their nephs so on and so forth and when we find a pious person whether they be a scholar or not anybody can be a saint but when we find a pious person and when their dua is accepted then we say this is a wali from so these are one of the friends the the saint in the islam is called is the friend of allah the friends of allah have no sadness upon them so it is the person who has achieved this consistency in this purity so when we look into the past we have no doubt that imam shafer was a saint we have no doubt that imam but that is were saintly people and we consider them from the qibla and we continue to benefit them from them and and many of them we follow their spiritual ways whether it be the likes of imam al-junaid or abdul khadr jilani or nakshaband or abu hassan or ahmed al-faye or chisti or mawlana rumi radhi allahu ahmad so these saintly people many of them will leave a path you know a formula that if you follow this formula you you will arrive at that purity as well and this is the discipline of hassan of teschi of tasawaf in the catholic world it's it's different you know they have a committee and they have to meet and they have their all of these conditions and one of the conditions is there has to be i don't know x number of miracles that have been witnessed by different people and then somebody on the committee has to be the devil's advocate that's where the term comes from it has to argue against against you know uh the the person being canonized and then if they agree and they vote and they sign a piece of paper then that person is now canonized they bring them to the canon of the of the of the um family of saints and they you know this is the the patron saint of of sailors and this is the patron saint of you know motorcycle riders and then and it's it's a very different process for us the greatest miracle that you can achieve in your life is to be consistent that's the greatest miracle and as a matter of fact the the big aolia the big uh saints in islam do not have miracles they're not the people that fly in the air and walk on water that's for the junior awliya the the massive awliya they're out there their sainthood comes simply from being consistent and that's why i say it is it is one of the rarest and hardest things in life is to be consistent but that is where greatness comes from is from that consistency so that's a little bit about the audience if while passing urine some of it splashes on my clothes pants etc do i need to change my clothes wash my clothes or can i simply wipe the area of the clothes so soiled what if some urine splashes on the leg while my wudu is nullified no the existence of the najesa does not nullify the wudu but the existence of the najesa needs to be purified by water so if some urine falls on someone's pants for example you can just wet that pot in that spot and then that would clean it automatically it's cleaned the water has that cleansing capacity so it doesn't negate the wudu at all you just have to make sure that your clothes are not carrying that najesa because if you pray with najesa that is large enough the prayer is invalid you have to remove that najesa before you pray again what does islam say about the environment in greening well the prophet saw saddam said do not harm the earth because it is your mother so you know that says it all the earth is our mother this is and the mother is the source of mercy is the source of life uh the the womb of the woman is called a and comes from rahman so if the prophet saws likened the earth to our mother collectively then we must show earth mercy towards the earth the prophet sallam said as is narrated in and narrowed by tiramidi the merciful ones receive mercy from the merciful runs so show mercy to all on earth men feel all on earth including the earth itself including the animals including the environment you shall receive mercy from the one in the heavens so our way is the way of mercy and uh when it comes to the environment and the natural surroundings we have all sorts of traditions about water use about trees about greens about fruits about animals you know the prophet saw said perfection excellence has been prescribed over everything so when you slaughter your animal you know make that excellent by sharpening the blade by diverting the animal's vision by not having the animal be anxious by making it happen quickly so in that there's mercy because when the animal is is super jacked up with with with fear and that fear and you and the animals killed as unfortunately happens with modern slaughtering mech procedures that the the the hormones that are that are sent out at the time of the execution but that's in the meat that we eat so we end up consuming that kind of stuff so there's a great hikman what the prophet saw is saying you know in those procedures of how the animal is slaughtered for example or are engaging rules of engagement in warfare about not harming the environment no scorch earth policy so on and so forth there's great wisdom in that because that's the source of our agricultural i mean look now with this fight in the ukraine people are talking about grain and food shortages and fuel so we have rules of engagement for those great great wisdoms behind that islam is probably the most green of all of the faiths because we have clear texts that talk about that that talk about the earth the talk about water that talk about rainfall so on and so forth so that would be a great subject for us in another venue to delve into because they're so it's very very rich and very very beautiful i am a diabetic and i need to inject insulin will my fast be valid i really want to observe my fast any intramuscular injection does not invalidate the fast but an intravenous injection would invalidate the fast so an insulin shot is fine while you're fasting in some communities and islamic countries it's a must for women oh sorry it's a must for men to cover their head with a skull cap or a cloth what is the accepted practice in the days of the prophet saws and what was the rule or the practice the difference of opinions amongst the hanafi's believe that it is a i believe it is a condition for the prayer that the man's head be covered uh but that's just a legal opinion clothes in general are custom custom based at the time of the prophet sam most men covered their heads they were a turban you know the prophet saws turban amongst other head coverings or a cap but i mean at times you know they would remove it of course if they were sleeping or washing you know they're making wudu or something like that in some at some times in early islam it would be considered improper for a man not to have their head covered in those times a lot of the literature about the head covering would would indicate for example if a man came femen didn't have uh didn't cover his his head then you couldn't accept his testimony for example in court because it was a sign of a morally corrupted person or somebody who is not morally upright or trustworthy because that's part of the package at that time that doesn't that's not the package now at all so it's customary so for men you don't have to cover your head it's a sunnah to cover your head and it's a sunnah to cover your head when you pray for example in in the dominant opinion although i travel during ramadan i like very much to fast understanding that there is a hadith that those who do not take advantage of the exemption given in the quran might not be pleasing to allah your guidance no if you are able to fast in this condi in this circumstance in ramadan it's better to fast if you're able to you have the dispensation uh to break your fast and to make it up later but because it's ramadan you know you know we all feel the same way i would just rather fast it's ramadan so in that case it's fine too fast as long as you're not harming yourself by the way in ramadan could i pray to hajjud soon after taraweeh and i need to get some sleep before federer and go to work i mean you could or you could consider taraweeh to be you know it's a sale it's a two-for-one it's taraweeh and and uh so kriyam doesn't have to be a separate separate act especially if you're going to have to sleep and then wake up for such word and go to work i want to motivate my kids who are seven and eight to fast even half a day your guidance yeah that's important the earlier people fast the easier it becomes when you fast when you're young then you are comfortable with that sensation of being hungry and through the sensation of the fasting person the longer you delay that the harder that sensation becomes to to live with not impossible of course but it just becomes like a big chore or a big task but when you fast from a young age then you just know that that's how your body feels and it's okay you can feel like that and everything is fine so yes as the question said to to ease them in um now the days are getting shorter it's not like in the peak of the summer so you know you why don't you fast or if they can do that why don't you on the weekends fast you know one whole day on the weekend but but during the week when you're at school faster or then or then maybe the second half of ramadan fast to lasa so on and so forth you just have to encourage them and you know make sure that they have their sahur because that's what gives them the strength make sure that what they eat is hearty you know if you just if you're just eating cereal for breaking your fast and cereal for sakura you're not gonna have any energy for the rest of the day while you're fasting so you need to also uh reinforce them with with foods that will help them inshallah and just you know reward them for it and praise them for it because it's a great task especially in our environment no one else around them or very few around them are also observing i have been in the restaurant business i do not serve liquor so far but this is a major drawback as other restaurants serve is it a sin to serve although i do not drink myself in the hanafi meth for muslim minorities living in non-muslim lands it's permissible to sell alcohol um you know of course you can't drink it that's haram universally but there is dispensation in the hanafi manhattan inshallah for that i heard by different imams that taking yoga classes is prohibited by islam because it is a buddhism practice i do that for years and it helped me a lot to recover from my physical issues i couldn't understand this fatwa please if you explain to me i will be very thankful yoga is a devotional practice that belongs to both hinduism and or largely hindu it's a hindu act of worship it's we are not allowed to engage in the ibeda of another religious tradition it's as simple as that because the philosophy the philosophy of yoga is it is meant to lead to a union with the almighty which for us is is heretical zahra we cannot become one with god lesaka mithlih nothing is like allah as i said a few questions ago and i answered the question about the other abrahamic face we are pure absolute monotheistic faith allah coming in me or me going into allah that's all impossible so we are not allowed to engage in the act of worship of another faith tradition you draw some benefit from it sure but you can also draw the same benefit by doing other type of exercises or other other type of physical rehabilitation or slash exercises so my advice is to seek out those other exercises or to do the exercises that help but don't call it yoga and don't you know don't use the language of the yogi and don't use the language of the of the yoga to avoid that we are following the act of worship of another faith tradition without doubt you must believe absolutely the prophet said for every ailment there is a cure so there is a cure for the physical ailments that you have it's not just going to be in this yoga but you'll find it in other types of physical activity stretching and so on and so forth what is the islamic ruling on in vitro fertilization as long as it's between husband and wife it's permissible if it involves a third person it becomes haram that's just the general rule so for husband and wife the wife's egg the husband's sperm it's fine what is the ruling on a dog being in the home differences of opinion between the alamet the dog should if if one wants a dog in the house it needs to be for a reason uh it barks when somebody comes to the front door it guards the house i mean there has to be a reason a seb if it's for no reason then it will then it we will enter into the you know the dislikes slash the haram as long as it's for a reason then you can have the dog uh then you run into two other problems the problem of najesa that can be for that can be circumnavigated by following the maliki position in which the dog is considered pure and then the second problem is the problem of the angels because there is a hadith that says that the angels do not appear in places where there are dogs so if you are going to have a dog in the house my advice would be to keep one room of the house dedicated for prayer that the dog is not allowed to go in and then that room is where you can say your prayers and then that way the angels will be in that space and not other spaces of the house so on and so forth i am intrigued by why arabic numerals are not used in the quran or in arabic textbooks probably a historical issue yes the in um in countries west of egypt libya uh algeria to uh algeria tunis morocco mauritania et cetera they use the arabic numerals in their books and in the namasah in egypt east they use the hindi numbers the exact reason why i'm not sure probably because of the impact of the persia and the hindi numbers that you know came from the that's where the seed of the khilafah was you know baghdad damascus you know the cities like basra kufa probably historically that's why some of the books or we started printing books for what it's worth i don't write those numbers that way i use the arabic numerals uh well one of it's it's you know easier for me because uh that's i grew up in the west so i i know i use those arabic numerals it is becoming more popular though by the way there are you know modern books that i find published uh in egypt or in the levant that are using the arabic numerals but it probably will never be as much as it is in the western side but it's it's that's an interesting thing so and we have to i'll have to do more digging is exactly why that happened why do imams discourage women to go to the cemetery during the burial process because they're not trained i don't know who the prophet saws himself said that i used to provide you from going to the graves indeed now go to the greats because it reminds you of death and the hereafter so there's no basis for that uh people in our culture and our background don't go to the grave and rip their clothes and yell and jump in the grave and if if a woman is going to do that or a man for that matter then we say don't go because you can't do that at the graveyard but no one's doing that we go to bury the dead to show our respects to pray et cetera et cetera and it's a great reminder it's the greatest reminder we all i mean just recently i visited our family grave plot here in cairo and it's a great reminder you know that that's where you're going to end up you know one day so it's it's important to have that part of your your thinking it's got to be there because you know this could be your last day you can go to sleep and not wake up so you want to be reminded of that not in a morbid way but in a way that motivates you in a way that makes you focus in a way that makes you return to allah subhanahu ta'ala it's it's a great act uh it has multiple multiple benefits so no that's fine for women to go okay the last question i have written here which seems to be a multiple part question on zakatul mel and then i see that the chat's going so i'll go back to that in a second on the cattlemen is there a book on zakatul mel zakat and male you will find the details discussion of it in fifth books can you suggest some english references um in the sheifei madhhab uh reliance of the travelers translated into english translated by sheikh muharrah keller and um obviously i'm going to show my bias now because i'm not sure of the english translations of the other but any any medhab of the four madhhabs of the uh hanafi the maliki the shepherd or the hambali metham whatever those whatever filk manuals of those who are they have as translated in english you will find the section of zakah because it's part of our badet it's part of our acts of worship which happens in the first part of the books um can an estimated zakker tulman be distributed equally over a year instead of one payment yeah you can do that if you if you have like holdings that you just you know you know that this is sort of what it's going to be like plus or minus yeah you can you can estimate the payments and you can actually pay two years up to two years in advance for zakatul men so that's that's that's possible too do you purify repeatedly the same amount of money as part of the cattle man if it is not used over a year yeah the zakker is the excess money after certain conditions uh have been fulfilled so when you have the nisab when you have the zakatible amount and then that zakatable amount has been in your complete ownership for one lunar year then you're going to pay 2.5 percent of that so that's extra that that's the purifying part so let's say you have i don't know 100 thousand dollars and it's just sitting there in an account or it's sitting there in a drawer or something like that and you know it's not going anywhere okay then you're gonna pay 2.5 next year that hundred thousand dollars is minus the 2.5 percent that you spend but that is still above the zakatible amount so you're going to take another 2.5 percent and if you leave it like that over time long period of time it will get slightly smaller and smaller and smaller part of the philosophy of the zakah is that it is an encouragement to use the money to put the money into something and you know to have the money work so money that's just laying around gets taxed because there's a lot of zakatul mel questions maybe after ramadan we can have a session just on zakat inshallah okay now i see there's a lot of questions in the chat so let me just go there well i still have would do even if i touch a hamster yeah touching the hamster hamster is pure even if you touched a pig or a or a dog you would still have wadu you just have to wash your hands i'm thinking of the quran let me just get the name it's a very hard book to find i mean you can find a pdf version of it but it's a book that was taken off the market uh because many of the shia la met were upset that he published it okay can i ask prophet muhammad or the awliya such as chishi to make dua for me yes that's a form of tawasu it's a form of intercession can daughters be given a share equal to the boys plus the one-third that can be willed can it be given to one of their heirs you can make a uh bequest of up to one third of your estate um the prophet saws so one third you can you can bequest up to one-third if you want to do more than one-third then all of the people that will inherit from you must agree to that family planning are women allowed to have a tubal negation procedure done in islam i have had three previous c-sections before this is risky my doctor's advised to get two vulgation let me look up what that is because i'm ignorant i apologize to location if it's with the doctor's advice then it's permissible sharia is very liberal when it comes to medical issues so if the doctors advise that and there's risk etc then that's fine is evil i true what should we do to counter evil eye is true and all of us have evil eye stories how do you counter that and you need something that takes the eye from the person whose eye you you fear who takes their eye away from from you so that's why a lot of people for example the front of their house they put like that blue eye thing that's where that idea comes from is that you're walking and then you see something and it distracts you even if it's for a moment that moment of distraction has taken the energy away from that person to that thing uh i've you know witnessed evil eye stuff all the time it happens but but the protection against it is quite easy so let's look at the home for example i mean just as an example so usually if you have something at the entrance of the home either outside or right inside i mean depending on how your house is or apartment or whatever that's that's an easy way that will just sort of just deflect deflect the person's energy because the evil eye is a type of energy that comes out from the person known to them or unbeknownst to them so other than corsi that's one way you can protect against it can i can i help protect others with ayat al-kursiya and other prayers if they've forgotten to pray for themselves of course you you the prophet saws said whoever can help their brother or sister then let them help them so this is a form of helping them yeah and some of some of our teachers you know would recite prayers for us and on our behalf all the time so this that's a great thing to be done is it bad in islam to be ambitious no the prophet saw some said ask and ask ask the highest highest level of paradise that's very ambitious because you know we know that we're not deserving of that so based on that no we have to if the muslims weren't ambitious they wouldn't have conquered you know north africa and andalus and constantinople and all and gone east all the way to china and that was part of their ambition um you have to think really really big and you have to be very ambitious but for the right reasons so you have to have the right intention all actions are based on intention but there's nothing wrong with having ambition who who amongst us is not ambitious and i've said it many times my ambition is that you know our message is the best message in north america you know what's wrong with that because it's going to strive and then when somebody else and another masjid sees that we openly say that they're going to feel like well we want to be the best message in these matters that are good let them you know compete with one another so by us being ambitious for the right reasons we encourage other peoples to also be ambitious so just raised the the the level of our quality so much so no we should be ambitious for the right reasons inshallah is there a hadith about when you pray that allah is in front of you how should i think about this when allah doesn't need space we pray towards a direction uh allah being in front of us is for us to remember that allah is with me that allah is observing not that allah is in a space but it's it's a it's a turn of phrase like the hadith that we just mentioned you know the one in the heavens will show mercenary but by saying the one in the heavens it means that allah is elevated it's the type of speech that elevates allah so when you say allah is in front of you what you're saying is allah is observing me he sees me and he hears me not that he's in a space often used in conversations please explain the context well it depends if your parents are yelling at you they say that means that they're very disappointed in you so it's a common turn it's a common phrase that we use because at the end there's no power or ability except by allah subhanahu ta'ala so when something bad happens or something negative happens usually it's like uh as the quran states with us you know if a calamity befalls them they say or when something bad happens we say we are acknowledging that that could that we couldn't have stopped that only allah has the ability to stop something like that there is no power but allah so yeah that's sort of how we we come to use it how would you recommend a person starts doing more in their islam i pray the father of the prayers and the minimum but i feel i should do more well if you pray the father the prayers you can try to pray some of the sunnah prayers but [Music] in the complex age that we live in the complex time that we live in zikr is the best tool that we have so i i believe that this is the age of thick this is the age of of when we need to make more invocation you know by starting in the morning by saying a hundred times from allah stuff from allah stuff a hundred times doing a hundred salawat on the prophet muhammad hundred times a hundred times doing that in the morning in the evening try that and then build build from there if you can do more than that then add more prayers on the prophet sasam during the day but be consistent the best of actions are those that are consistent even if they are few can we use prescription eye drops during the day during ramadan if we forget to do it at night yeah imam shafi he said that the the eye duct uh does not constitute the body cavity but the mouth the ear and you know uh uh the the privates would constitute the uh a body cavity but the eye duct the the water going into the eye duct it comes usually down the nose did not uh consider that to be part of the body cavity and therefore using eye drops during the fasting day or while your fasting does not invalidate the fast inshallah if i change a baby's diaper while wearing disposable gloves will this still break my wudu no because you there's a hat there is a something between you and the and the private part of the child what breaks your wudu is that if you're your hand if you put both of your hands together whatever is touching the other hand if if if whatever is outside touches the the baby's body a private part does not break your wadoo what invalidates is this so you could even you know if you touched it like that it wouldn't value that you would do if you were gloves it wouldn't invalidate your mother is there a hadith about when you pray no we got although we got that hadith it's a repeat asking to be deserving of the highest heaven i get that but how about a worldly ambition such as a promotion at work or an example for the right reason and you you don't want to be the prophet sasan sought refuge from allah from poverty because poverty is very debilitating and and it puts so much pressure on the person that it's difficult for them to to live an upright you know decent life so not wanting to be in poverty having lawful gain to be able to support yourself your family to be able to support charitable works that you want to be able to support your message i mean etc etc those are all lofty reasons but you know i i want um i want um this special job you know so i can show everyone how great i am that's not a so good reason that's your nephew speaking so it's about the intention all actions are nothing but their intentions that's what the hadith means so what's your intention for wanting that for being ambitious you have to be ambitious imam al-ghazali says if you're not ambitious if you don't have that drive in you something's wrong with you uh if you don't get angry he's you're not normal because normal people get angry the question is what you do with that anger so the same thing here if you're not ambitious if you have no ambitious you're not normal something is not right you're sort of like vanilla if everyone's like yeah whatever yeah whatever if everything's like that then there's that's not it's not a normal disposition there has to be something that lights your fire maybe you haven't found it yet so on and so forth but that passion and that drive that ambition that's what leads to excellence because if you if you have passion for something and especially if it's supported by the right intention then inshallah you'll accomplish great things with it so there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever again it all comes back to your intention so those are the questions that i have before me is there anything that somebody wants clarified i'm sorry some of the questions took a little bit longer to answer but there's another question if i make a car for protection from the evil like the jinn evil eye center am i completely protected what i'm confused about is that what if someone still harms me because allah willed it then you're entering into the level of wisdos you have to trust that that the prophet saws and what allah says so you can't live you know in fear like that if you take these basic protections you will be protected because the jinn the evil and all of that stuff don't have power over the speech of allah don't have power over those things so if you're if you're making your five prayers a day if you most of the day you're in a state of wudu if you i mean that's your protection you don't need more than that if allah wants something to happen doesn't matter what you do it's going to happen that's qatar it's good and it's bad it's sweet and it's bitter so that's but you can't go you know along the day all the time always thinking about it like that it's going to be too overwhelming so insha allah you'll be okay thank you for clarifying we are free to ask of allah as long as it's from a clean heart yes shall allah insha'allah think about what the people before us did in human history think about the fact that everything we know about western philosophy came from the preservation of that philosophy from the muslims which means that muslims encountered foreign language learned the foreign language to the point that they could translate that work into arabic primarily but also farsi commented on that use that added to that and it is those translations and those translations alone that where that that philosophy still remains think about the fact that the muslims of al-andalus saved the hebrew language that it were if it were not for them the hebrew language would have disappeared the jews of the andalus used to write hebrew using arabic letters and it was the free space that islam afforded the jews of spain that allowed them to be able to revive hebrew once again think of the inventions and think of the civilization and the architecture and the art and the poetry and the music the literature that came from our ancestors and that came from ambition that came from internalizing the quran and the sunnah that unleash this creative power and unlock this this potential so we need to be those people but today uh and to bring sanity to an insane world you that will only happen if we are ambitious so as long as our intentions we're thinking like on those levels on that level yeah i want to do something great and i i want to you know i want this to benefit the the ummah and etc etc allah will facilitate for you anybody else um since last ramadan we've had an unbroken monthly session of ask dr tariq and i did a rough count there have been a minimum of 500 questions which have been answered uh i'm not i'm usually bad at math but this one i got it properly checked and 500 plus questions have been asked and answered by you and on on an average at least 40 to 50 people watch these sessions and if you think that in a household there are two people watching then you have 100 people [Music] watching this program um and i know that since you moved to egypt uh you get up at this hour at the hundredth time to to devote your time to us and i ask this dua on behalf of everybody including those who are not here but who listen to it online for the service that you have done and for the patients with which farida and the children have allowed you to do this from a distance i also want to say that we really admire the way you and imam refi and karyanas work together on these because some of the questions that are asked of them they reflect them to you and if you get more comfortable it's because they are outsourcing their questions to you and you can do the same to them as well but we really really wanted to say uh thank you to you and may allah bless you look forward to your coming back and imam refi and zamaruda and the team i have prepared an exciting ramadan program uh of which you will also be part and center center central to it so inshallah we will see you in a few weeks thank you uh i i had no idea that we've we've had them unbroken i i uh had you told me a year ago that we have this planned for the year i wouldn't have believed you uh so i'm i'm quite surprised alhamdulillah allah is merciful and generous and as i always say i am grateful to the community for this opportunity it's these questions that allow me to stay sharp and to formulate these answers and articulate what i believe is important so i i am in much of need of them as as everyone else so alhamdulillah is a great blessing upon all of us and um it's absolutely my pleasure well it's not such a pleasure to get up in the middle of the night i must say but but after the first few minutes of waking up i'm you know looking forward to being with everyone and inshallah soon i'll be with everyone uh at the end of the month soon as brother muslim says so we ask allah to continue to bless our community and our families and and we ask allah to bless us in this month of sha'ban and to bring us safely to the month of ramadan and we ask allah to accept our our acts of worship our prayer and our zakah and our fasting we ask allah subhanahu ta'ala to make this uh this ramadan a month of victory over ourselves you know ramadan is traditionally the month of victory we ask allah subhana tala for that victory over ourselves and to continue to protect our families and our parents and our our children and to have mercy on those who we love who have passed before us inshallah there's just one question i think that came in i just wanted to answer that uh for the dog question when it says the angels don't enter the house what is the difference defined as the house like with a garage or extension building that people don't usually live in it be included as part of the house or the angels don't enter no the hadith is where they the angels don't occupy the same space as the hou as the dog one of the hadiths of gabriel was coming to the prophet saws with revelation but there was a dog like by him or under the bed so gabriel didn't come in because of the presence of the dog there is some sort of relationship between angels and dogs that the angels don't come with that's the meaning of the hadith so wherever the dog is then that's not going to be a spot where the angel is going to be but dogs are creatures the prophet saws he said were not that the dogs are an ummah like you i would have asked you to remove them or to or to you know to to to to kill them so the prophet sasam referred to dogs as an ummah like us like we are an ummah of people they're an ummah of dog other allah's creation we use dogs for hunting we use dogs for guarding we use dogs for guidance so it doesn't mean that something is wrong with the dog but there is that natural association between the dog and the angel so wherever the dog is going to be the angel is not going to be so therefore if we have a dog in the house let us keep the door let us keep one room for the prayer so that's the prayer that's the room of the baraka the room of the angels so on and so forth and that space idea by the way is real i mean there are uh i have been in spaces that have only been used for prayer only being used for thick and you feel something different when you're in that space then when you're like at a starbucks or something like that there's there's definitely that exists so uh we honor the spaces that we're in uh and that's just one way of honoring them inshallah and thank you uh referee and anas for outsourcing or sending all these questions now i know who to blame when i'm back insha allah so thank you for the added work uh and um any time revise us anytime and i i'm looking forward to to being with everyone i i have some some things planned even as i was preparing for this session i was thinking about the ramadan and this and that already getting emails about there's an iftar here and then so i'm already sort of festive in the ramadan mood in inshaallah so i look forward to being with everyone soon inshaallah and we continue our sunday sessions until right before ramadan in sha allah [Music] take care you
