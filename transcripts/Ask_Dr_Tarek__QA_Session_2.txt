welcome back to our open uh question and answer session uh before i begin last time or a couple of weeks ago i believe i was asked who will win the u.s elections uh and i responded i responded that we can announce to our entire community definitively that inshallah one of the two candidates will win so i still stand by that answer one of the two candidates will ultimately prevail and i think we all know who that's going to be so far inshallah so i'm not chatting i'm just reading the questions from my phone okay the first question is what is the minimum number of people required for drama prayer uh there's a difference of opinion uh in the shariah in the shepherd method of the method that i follow it has to be 40 free non-traveling men that's the technical definition including the khatib in our current masjid situation every time i have led juma outside we've had 40 plus men that are that i know are community members so that's fine if due to covet restrictions we have to reduce the number of people at jomar we would simply be following another method that would allow a lesser amount i believe i i believe in the hambani school it might even be just two people the imam or the khatib and somebody to listen to them so what's more important in this situation is having jummah rather than sticking to one medha because if we don't have drama then we prevent a great good for the community so in this this is a this is a situation in which we would be very very flexible to facilitate having jummah now let's say for example we wanted to follow strictly one of the opinions and let's say i'm following my method strictly i show up i start doing the khutba and then i notice that we haven't reached the 40 people but i wanted to follow my opinion that all i would do is after the prayer i would stand up and i would pray for raka's for to compensate for the fact that according to my school the jummah was not complete but i would not not come to jummah you know what i'm saying so just trying to emphasize the point that having jomah in this country when we can whether it's online or whether it's you know with reduced numbers at the mosque is a is vital vitally important for the uh for the welfare of our community second question is i hear different opinions about reciting quran while visiting graves my understanding is that you can make dua while visiting and absolutely should not recite fatah harya sin could you please clarify no we are any good works that we can do for our deceased is in the benefit of the deceased so reciting quran and donating the reward of that recitation to the deceased is one of the great rewards that we can do so uh whether that be at the grave site itself or whether it be here wherever we are and we just recite quran and or we do some thicket or or we say a prayer or whatever and then we we our intention is that that reward will go to that deceased or to all the deceased amongst the muslims so on and so forth so no that's not correct it's it is fine to recite the quran for the deceased to pray for them the prophet salallahu sallam he said one of the things that uh benefits us after our death is somebody who's left behind who prays for us and reciting quran is certainly one of those things uh or sacrificing an animal and donating it to the poor and feeding people or giving money in charity and giving and intending that the reward of that charity go to that person so on and so forth all of that is permissible all of that is delivered to the deceased and and without diminishing from our reward what is the best way to dispose of papers that have quran or hadith written on it we often get males with quotes from the quran is shredding it okay is there another way yeah shredding it is fine because you you cut up the the letters so then therefore it's no longer hadith or it's no longer quran you could burn it but i know that that could be overwhelming especially if you don't have a fireplace or if you live you know for your neighbors it could bother your neighbors and things like it might not be very practical but burning it is another way but shredding it shredding it is fine i would i would shred it i would or you can cut it with scissors if it's just a couple of sheets and it's not too too much um my kids are crazy for gummy bears some say it is not hallel some say now the gummies are made in turkey so they may be halal what do i tell my kids i too like gummies and eat them secretly i am of the opinion that uh gummies and and the like are permissible uh because any trace amount of the gelatin that exists in the product from the sharia point of view will be diluted so the sharia has a concept of dilution that something can be diluted to the point that its chemical compound the the original chemical compound would change so the original chemical compound no no longer is there and that is the opinion that i follow and that i give people so you don't have to eat the gummies in secret or marshmallows things like that um can non-muslims participate in washing the body no can a wife participate in washing the body of her husband no so all of the inherited methods that we have is that the people that wash the deceased must be of the same muslim and of the same gender there is a very unique position that belongs to imam ali ali washed his wife say the fatima but that was that incident was not taken by any of the methods so that's like a solitary unique opinion that if we were in a dire situation and you know if if my wife died and there were no women around her you know i could you know maybe follow that opinion but the standard opinion that all of the madahip have is that it's muslim and of the same gender in south asian custom they do not allow women to view the shrouded geneza your guidance no there's no prohibition of women praying the geneza prayer attending the funeral attending the burial making dua this is one of the examples that we teach in us when we teach student students of abrogation of nasr because the prophet saw had forbade women from visiting the graves and then he said i used to ask you not to go visit the graves now you can go and visit them so and that's a standard example that we use when we talk about abrogation in the sunnah when we teach to our students so there's nothing wrong with that this is simply cultural there is in some muslim majority cultures we have this idea that the woman her sheikh is her husband every woman's sheikh is her husband and the woman she only goes out three times she goes out once from her the belly of her mother she goes out twice second time from the house of her father to the house of her husband and she goes out a third time from the house of her husband to the grave you know we don't live in that world anymore you can't you can't tell young girls that now maybe that worked 100 200 300 years ago but now society has changed so we we inherit a lot of cultural baggage in muslim majority cultures especially when it has to do with gender and sometimes we mix that up and we think that that's islam that has nothing to do with islam there's nothing in the sharia whatsoever that prohibits a woman women used to fight in battle with the sahaba next next to the sahaba and the prophet and you can't get more you know there's no more endorsement endorsement than that okay question regarding time when we are not allowed to pray for example during the peak of the sun can you please be little specific with this time for instance if zohar is at one we should not pray from 12 45 to 1 is that correct same applies for sunset time there are a few times that there are hadith that talk about not praying during those times for example we do there is no prayer after you pray fajr prayer before the sun rises there's no prayer and then as the disc of the sun is rising from the horizon there's no prayer and then right when the sun is in the the zenith of the sky meaning right before the prayer as the person answered in the question there's no prayer so that's three times the fourth time is after assad prayer there's no prayer and the fifth time is as the disc of the sun is descending in the horizon meaning right before merib there is no prayer in other words there is no prayer without reason but let's say i prayed fajr at home and then after i prayed fajr at home i went straight to the mosque and the sun still hadn't come up as i enter the mosque i can pray the two raka's to greet the mosque because i'm praying for a reason so the prohibition against the prayer during those five times is without reason such that there be no ever confusion or assumption that you are praying to honor some type of astronomic phenomena of the sun rising you know so there's no confusion that muslims are worshiping the sun at these times and things like that that's one of the reasons behind it but if there's a reason why you're praying praying is tihara or i forgot to pray a prayer and i need to make it up and it happens to be one of those times that's fine the prohibition is to pray without reason uh what is the f regarding listening to music playing instruments singing nasheeds and playing instruments with singing so this is unfortunately one of those uh questions that occupy a lot of our bandwidth these days uh music is a natural phenomenon in other words it's the measure of sound in a certain duration of time it's something that uh exists and allah created it in the natural world whether listening to nature or listening to the birds or whatever the case may be we are making sound as we speak now air is coming out you are hearing me and i can make this sound sound nice or i can make this sound sound bad when i read quran it doesn't sound like when anus reads quran and we we would all much rather listen to enemies read and then read quran even though we both might recite it technically correctly but what's what's the difference between his recitation and my recitation his sounds better there's more music to it there's more rhythm to it his voice is stronger he's been gifted with that masha'allah so music the measure of sound in time and in certain intervals this time is a natural phenomena so the first thing we have to understand is that it's natural the reason we have to understand it's natural is to understand what i'm about to say about music the of the past invented and studied music and sound and rhythm to give uh different ways of reciting arabic poetry different meters of reciting the arabic poetry and those meters those with those makhans those stations of reciting the arabic poetry are the same way we recite the quran so that the quran can sound well and sound appropriate so the verses of the paradise sound a certain way the verses of the hellfire sound a certain way the the stories of the past of the sound a certain way the verses that talk about the glory of allah sound a certain way so on and so forth this is part of the study of how of the recitation of the quran it's not just simply tajweed anyway to make a long story short music is not in itself haram and musical instruments are not in themselves haram what would be haram is if the music had something in it that was haram or made people do haram things the reason people get caught up with this issue is that the hadith that talk about that associate the proliferation of listening to music and musical instruments with the nearness of the final hour imam and now we and others they understand the hadith of the signs of the final hour in the following ways that whenever the prophet lists something or whenever allah in the quran lists something not everything in that list takes the same ruling so that's the first mistake that people make they think that because things are coupled together that means it's all haram because the hadith that talk about musical instruments also talk about fornication also talk about drinking alcohol with other names as all being signs for you so because fornication is obviously haram and drinking alcohol is haram they assume that also musical instruments are haram but how come no one has come and said we're building tall buildings is haram because in the hadith of gabriel one of the signs of the prophet isalam said of the final hour is that people will compete in building tall buildings so the second thing imam and now we said is just because something is a sign of yom al-qiyamah it doesn't mean that it's inherently haram it's just simply a sign it's just a sign that when you see this then know that the hour is near so that's sort of the understanding of of some of those but i i uh and of course there are different opinions about specific musical instruments i follow the opinion that the musical instruments are not haram that music itself is not haram that singing is not haram as long as it is um something laudable it has good lyrics it's not talking or praising something that is haram and most importantly doesn't it doesn't promote doing something haram and therefore people listen to this music while doing something haram that type of association could lead us to say okay that type of music is haram but it's a concept it's not i remember one of my teachers he said if you listen to beethoven's ninth symphony it's all about tawheed you know so the people that know the people that have deep knowledge that's how they look at music and sound and they see the beauty the beauty in these sounds is beautiful and he loves that which is beautiful what is the ruling regarding taking a housing mortgage it's halal if i get interest on a bank deposit is it haram no if i give it as a sadaqa is it okay yes and you can give it to me and i will accept that inshaallah or you could donate it to the mosque but no it's not hara i'm just kidding it's not haram um there's a significant number of young educated professional american muslim women who are having difficulty finding muslim spouses some marry outside the faith others are well into their thirties with no prospects they face a limited pool of spouses are there any practical initiatives flexibility and interpretation et cetera that are being taken to help these young women so this is a a big problem i admit that it's a big problem and it's funny just the other day might even be on the weekend i was mentioning this to my wife uh and because i have some female students abroad and uh i was commenting about you know they might even be some of them you know my age category and still not married and we were sort of talking about maybe what the problem is so it is a problem uh a lot of the problem has to do is that men seem to be less and less mature these days uh and you know i feel as a man i can say that and you know people you can get mad but i feel i have the right to say that because i also have guy students and you know i see that they're maybe not as serious uh some of them uh as we were and when we were young i remember people used to comment that we were like a loser generation and not like the previous generation so it's kind of one of those things but there are guys are just not mature they don't want to commit they want to party they want to have a good time and that's part of the problem but i mean i don't want to take up the the time now to you know to lament the problem let's kind of look at the solutions one thing to note is that as a community we have you know we have like a non-published you know um i don't want to say we have a matchmaking uh service but we do try to to serve that role so if people are in the community listening to this are serious about marriage you should get in touch with one of us and we will do our best to you know try to facilitate those type of things without any any promise but we are cognizant that this is a serious issue and even recently we had a nikah in the mosque alhamdulillah and we've you know we've conducted many of those over the years so and that is one of the vital roles that a muslim center uh in this country should provide uh so i think i i think maybe what's in the question is this idea of marrying outside of the faith and there is no dispensation to that that is something that is universally understood as impermissible that part of the validity of a marriage in the sharia is that both the bride and the groom share the same faith only in the hanafi method is there some dispensation for a man marrying really strictly only a christian or a jew uh other than that the other madagas don't allow that even even for a man as as i know that you've heard me say that before so it's not about new interpretation or anything like that it's about at some points if a woman wants to marry somebody outside of the faith at some point conversion has to happen or else it's it there's no way to conduct the nikkei as an aka because that is one of the conditions for the necaf to be valid uh so i think the solution has to be really on us as the community for us to come together and us to help people match and but i i don't know personally unless somebody comes to me and says look i'm trying to get married can you help me and or this is what i'm kind of like looking for so other than being you know other than the specifics i'm just trying to give some general comments okay those are the questions that were sent now there are a lot of questions in the chat um given the situation in france there has been much discussion about how islamic law views blasphemy apostasy this concept is sensitive to talk about amongst muslims and non-muslims where they see countries like pakistan where blasphemy laws are used to target minorities or excuse vigilantism could you perhaps go into detail on how islamic law deals with blasphemy apostasy and how to bring this discussion into the modern context first of all i have no problem talking about anything related to islam and islamic law in the modern world because it's this is a legal system just like any other legal system so i think i i don't like to phrase things like that oh this is difficult to talk it's not difficult to talk about because it's it's law and where there's law there's a reason behind the law and there's evidence and there's interpretation and there's application and precedence and all that kind of stuff so specific countries aside it is haram in our religion to blaspheme it is haram to to curse god you know would either be even the thought one shudders even even thinking that or to curse the prophet or to curse uh the mothers of the believers or or so on and so forth the curse the family of the prophet i mean these things are haram we know that this is abc of islam it's almost you know some things that are just evidently no necessarily known so that's different than what happens if that happens in other words for the punishments that talk about cursing the prophet salam specifically because this is what the issue is about those are issues that have to be adjudicated in court not adjudicated in the court of public opinion it's haram and detestable and and me like any one of you i find that reprehensible and and and i cringe when i hear people refer to our prophet uh in derogatory terms i mean if you do not feel bad when you hear somebody cursing the prophet saws something is wrong with your iman of course i detest that and i'm not going to be shy in defending the prophet or defending islam or defending the quran or defending our faith at all don't we don't have to be apologetic but that's completely different than what happens in a court proceedings if somebody actually did that because the the key for those type of capital punishments to be exacted in and according to the sharia is that the person doing that knowingly willfully completely within their mind understood all of the implications of the act and did it nonetheless and those conditions are almost impossible to fulfill today i in the first year or two in the mosque a lady came up to me after a prayer jummah and she said my brother people are trying to kill him in in their home country it was bangladesh or pakistan i can't remember which one i said why i said oh well he wrote something you know bad about the prophet assalam i said what did he say and she told me what he said and i said yeah that's not blasphemy that's just rude we don't we don't refer to the prophet sallam like that it's not like he left islam leaving islam is a huge act uh tell your brother just you know not to not to speak about the prophet i saw something like that because it's not respectful so the judge the mufti the khaji has to investigate those matters and see does this person know do they not know all those people in france all they know about muslims that muslims live in the ghetto muslims are criminals muslims are sleazy people so they're not making fun of rasulullah our rasulullah they're making fun of something else some false image in their mind the prophet himself when the when the people of quraish made fun of him and then those people knew who he was and they called him within them the cursed one and the sahabah said why don't we respond you know let us go strike them the prophet i saw someone said they're making fun of some guy named mudem but i am muhammad sallallahu assam so our job is to have that attitude is to show them through our acts through our expression of love through our compassion who the prophet is and not to automatically assume okay these people they're they're making fun of the prophet i read in a book that was written you know centuries ago that this is haram and and i have to go strike these people down that's completely not islam that's not that's not what the book says that's not what those hadith mean nor have they been interpreted to mean that because those are issues that must and can only be adjudicated through the court these are not there is no vigilantes vigil vigilia and vigilantism in islam there has to be the qadhyar the mufti is the one that would adjudicate these cases meaning that the person has to be brought before the judge they have to investigate ask him a series of questions now no one knows this because no one wants to go read those books they only have certain parts of the books that are in their mind if you read any book about islamic courts or being a mufti or training the process of issuing a fatwa you would these things are evidently clear that's on sort of blasphemy as far as apostasy there is no capital crime associated with apostasy as such meaning simply that somebody decides to leave islam that is not a capital offense even though it's a great moral sin the prophet when you gather the hadith that talk about apostasy he said the person that is killed is the person that leaves their faith and by so doing has breached the security of the community which in our modern language is like a spy you know if i was a spy for another country living in this country this is treasonous a treasonous act now selling secrets or illegally or acquiring secrets or trade secrets or did they talk about corporate espionage there's political espionage so that that type of capital punishment in our literature is about that not about simply somebody decided not to stop being muslim there were many examples of people that came from the desert became muslim memorized parts of the quran prayed with the muslims and then left to go back to the to the to their polytheistic beliefs in the desert and the prophet never ever wants there's no single piece of evidence that he asked somebody or he ordered such a person to be killed any capital offense was understood for either a capital crime that they committed or that they had sold seeker like the munafiku and munafikun were selling state secrets to the quraish they were literally telling the quraish where the defensive positions and the storehouses were in medina during the battle of the ditch so that's treason you know textbook treason anyway that's what that stuff is about moving on last time i mentioned that while in the dunya lineage is determined through the father and then the lineage is determined through the mother could you please elaborate yeah you know when we do the talking at the graveyard when the person is buried and the person does the talking they they do the talking by saying so and so the son of and they mentioned the mother that's what i meant so again people they have a superficial under not not the questioner but people have a superficial understanding of our attitude towards men and women you know what's going to last longer the dunya or the and in the we refer to you as the son of your mother so you know that's that shows us the importance of of the mother isa ibn maryam allah says in the quran most of them are they say when when mary uh said that when um the mother of mary said that that she was pregnant with a woman and she said well because they wanted to have a son so they could dedicate the son to the temple and then when they found out that they were going to have a girl and then the quran says and the boy is not like a girl most of them will face they say because the girl is more special than the boy and that's the interpreter or one of the interpretations of those verses anyway so i was just i like to emphasize these points sometimes so people have a balanced approach that doesn't mean that the lineage from the father is canceled when you die when you die of i don't of course that's not what i mean i'm just trying to point something out also let us remember that all of the lineage of the prophet alaihis salaam goes through his daughter say the say the fatima alayhis for a woman so the nessa of the prophet sallam goes back through a woman to start out with that's also another important fact that we oftentimes overlook if you cannot recite the quran yourself can you get someone like an imam to recite and give them so the deceased yeah anybody can can can give reward can conduct a a pious act and donate the reward of that act to any of the deceased any of us can do that i can read quran now read the fatah now and ask that the reward be given to all of the deceased of our community that's that's fine or all to all muslims that have passed away etc so and and what i do and what i think we should all be doing is every day at the end of every prayer when we do the prayer when we sit after the prayer and we do our dua we should always add two things we should add one do i for our parents specifically and we should add one dua for all those who have passed away from the muslims to get in that habit that we want to be connected with our brothers and sisters uh do ghosts exist ghosts meaning souls of dead people roaming in this world sure i mean from that point of view the souls uh uh of the deceased are still alive and that's why people have dreams of the deceased and and things like that but they don't roam around like you know like in the movie in the movie ways but they roam around in the sense that when you sleep and your soul is slightly detached from your body it can meet with the other souls and discourse etc they say there is a time during juma that are surely heard and answered likewise time before mer is that so yes and this is one of the things that they say that allah has hidden allah has hidden the hour the moment on juma that the dua is accepted so that on jummah we spend as much time as we can doing dua allah has hidden the accepted dua in the last third of the night so that we would stay up the last the entirety of the last third of the making allah has hidden the saintly person amongst us so therefore we will respect everyone amongst us and be even with them allah has hidden from us in the odd nights the final odd nights of ramadan so that we are vigilant every night allah has hidden which act that we have committed that will be accepted so that we constantly engage in good acts allah has hidden his supreme name in his 99 beautiful names so that we we hold on and talk about all of his names so there are many things that allah has hidden for the purpose of that we seek the entirety out so this is one of those things that allah has hidden from us the moment the hour and the moment on friday when the dua is accepted that is true what is islam's view on adoption or adoption adopted children allowed to receive any inheritance adoption in the west is permissible because there might not be another way in the west for us to be able to bring children who are orphans into family care so for that reason it's permissible as long as they know that they are adopted and there's some way that you know we can maintain their original name if possible as far as inheritance the the adopted children do not inherit by law but you can bequest to them you can leave for them something and the quests bequests will see is part of the sharia and you can bequest up to a third of your your wealth to anybody for anything if it's more than a third you must take the permission of all of those people that would inherit from you naturally so that's how you can solve that problem what is the best way to connect with god while you are partying i don't think praying things might be a typo i think it means praying what is the best way to connect with allah when you are praying how do you have joshua there are a couple of of uh of you know secrets that imam al-ghazali talks about with the prayer one of them is that he says that the prayer is like one long uninterrupted sentence there is no quiet moment in the prayer you say allahu akbar and then immediately you say the dua the opening to others are many of them but you can select one or two of them and then you say you say and then you say asura and then allah akbar so your allahu akbar lasts the duration of your motion and the minute you finish allahu akbar you're already in rakuwa so right away you say subhana subhana rabbin adams so if you follow that pattern there's no quiet moment in the prayer it's like one long sentence the key is that your allahu akbar lasts the duration of your moment that has a very uh you know special effect on on you if you do it and you continually do it because what ends up happening is that there's it's like one long uninterrupted sentence between you and allah and if you do that and there's no quiet moment in the prayer then what happens is you you lessen the opportunity for your mind to wander and you're more focused on the prayer that's one one that's you know uh courtesy of imam al-ghazali another thing that i found personally myself personally is to not let the prayer be too long because if you try to overdo it and make the prayer too long your mind has more of an opportunity to wander so i'm not saying pray fast but i'm just saying pray the way you need to pray say the things you need to say and then move to the next motion following imam al-ghazali's thing and i have found that that you you know that when you're about to pray it really only takes a couple minutes it's you're only you're only you're only asking yourself to quiet your mind to quiet your heart for two or three minutes i mean how long can four raka's actually take five minutes seven minutes that's it so therefore it's not like oh i have to go do this like one hour meditation uh you know session no it's just i'm just gonna bust out my four rakaas doing everything properly saying everything in its right way and that's it three times fatah asura three times three times salaam salaam and that's it so i find that that is helpful to not let the mind wander and to do what i'm saying all the time so don't don't do it for a little bit and then stop the sentence this like one long sentence strategy make that the way that you pray inshallah that will help facilitate your joshua do jin exist in and around our homes what forms can they take yeah the gin exists without doubt uh however we don't have that much interaction with them uh despite what a lot of people think in uh in the homeland where you know every every calamity is attributable to a gin um so that's obviously exaggerated like somebody falls from a tree and they start shaking they say oh he's possessed by the jinn well i think it's because he fell from the tree and fell on his head he needs to go to the doctor not not to the imam so sometimes people they just they just it's just an easy out um i i do not have much experience with the jinn i asked one of my teachers and he had one or two jin stories um that were very that confirmed my understanding of the jinn that the jinn are not very smart the jinn are not very powerful that they really don't have that much interaction they're easily the badges are easily scared away um and you know they're a good gin and badge and so sometimes the good gin can come to the assistant you know in certain circumstances but unlike most people they do not occupy a lot of my mind i do not think about the jinn a lot so i do not know that much about them but yeah they are there they exist and i if i'm not mistaken it might have been imam malek or imam shafi uh one of them who said if anyone claims that they have seen a jinn in their true form then they are no longer allowed to be called as a witness in court or in a document or in a marriage because that is that is not possible so the people that have seen the jinn or interacted with the jinn they are not interacting with them in their true form uh which will be unseen by by by man or woman but rather a mutation of the format and because i've never seen the gin nor do i i want to or plan to see the gin so i do not know more than that um is there any guidance in islam around child bearing i understand the entire child bearing process is a miracle from allah however i could not find a concrete reason for why people have kids is there any guidance on this all the reasons i could think of feel selfish to me example to add meaning to life to continue family lineage please excuse my ignorant feminine graveyard no i mean there's nothing wrong with that wealth and children are the um the beautiful trappings of this world uh it's beautiful it's natural to want to have children it's natural to not want to be lonely especially for women you know women when they get to a certain age for many women it's just natural they want to have children allah has placed this in us as a as a an inborn need because by doing this is how we we we preserve our species you know or else we would become extinct so it's a it's a it's a natural thing that allah has created within us the coupling of of two mates uh allah has created a pair for each thing he says on the quran for everything we have created two pairs so that's also in in nature around us you know every plus there's a minus uh uh so for for every man there'll be a a woman and vice versa which emphasizes that the original understanding of marriage in islam is a monogamous relationship not a multiple marriage by the way uh even though the shadia allows for that uh and it is natural therefore that to to to produce children the prophet saw he said mary have children so i can show off about the the number of my community uh so again the prophet saws encouraged us to do that the only time that's not encouraged is or one of the times when that's not encouraged is if it's not a good age to live in if there's a lot of fitnah and some of that is objective but some of that is also subjective um so other than that it's just what i'm that's those things that you've discovered whoever asked the question that's natural there's no it's what is the natural inheritance law and i encourage everyone to do that especially in this country because if you don't have a will it can create a mess uh when somebody passes even if you don't think you have any possessions or anything uh things can get confusing and uh worse the state can can end up taxing people and taking things that they shouldn't be taking and things like that so having a will very simple will is important i'm not a state lawyer or anything like that so i can't advise you how to do that but it's not too complicated to put together a very simple will um as far as inheritance in islam it's a it's a bigger topic but there are certain categories of people that always inherit there are some categories there are categories of people that sometimes inherit and there are different fractions and it's basically a mathematical map where when somebody dies you see who's left and then you see who of these people is a universal inheritor then they get their their share and and do they block any of the next linea next tier from not receiving their share and then whatever is left is distributed uh you know if you've leave parents behind if you leave children behind grandchildren siblings things like that um so it's it's just much more complex it's too complicated to to go over now but that's just basically how inheritance works or inheritance law what it discusses organ donation is it permissible most of the bodies today allow organ donation i follow the more conservative position that it is not permissible so i myself i believe that it's not permissible and i do not i am not an organ donor or or and that's what i teach my children and and my students but most of the of the major fish bodies allow it so you can say that there's a difference of opinion and people can follow what they feel inclined to anybody have anything else see if i got any messages uh uh you mentioned that one exception is when the times are not right when the time is difficult um would would could be or with considering this time as being a difficult time to have or to bring the child into this world is that something you said it's subjective and if i believe that that sin uh that's that's my question i mean some i mean some things [Music] the time not being a good time some things about that are subjective and other things are objective for sure there are great challenges now uh but there are some people who live in circumstances in which you know the their little piece of earth is fine they don't have any of those challenges so on the whole it's a great time of fitna without doubt the the age that we live in i mean i would never go so far as to tell people not to have children because i don't feel that's my right to do that after everything that i just said it being natural and and whatnot and i have children myself and things like that but there's no doubt that it's it's a bad bad time uh from many many points of view uh and uh especially for us in the west it's it's a very very bad time and we are you know there is an onslaught of this uh ultra you know left progressive uh agenda that infringes on many of our core beliefs the belief in the absolute and and certain things that are not not changeable for us that's going to present huge problems for the next generation and it's going to happen slowly and boom all of a sudden it's going to be in everyone's face and then be like oh and you know and that's really kind of what's happened kind of what's happening in france is you know the french do not like islam they do not want any organized religion for not because they because of islam because of the concept of organized religion vis-a-vis what they think a modern secular uh republic stands for i mean they're they're they're fanatical they're just as fanatical about that stuff as isis is fanatical about what they believe in they're two sides of the same coin and then you know you're like a muslim family just trying to you know live a decent life and and have you know go to the mosque and pray and and fast ramadan and earn halal income and that's all you want to do but now you're forced to no no you can't wear the hijab in school you can't wear the hijab in this building and so there's a lot of fitna in that uh and imam shepherd you know who who is from the south way in the beginning he said if there's if there's fitna at your time like in our time that's imam shepherd saying that then it's okay not to have children or to limit the number of children that you have so i can only imagine what he would say if he lived in our time but but again that's also maybe i'm putting my bias in that question in that answer maybe somebody will not see it like that maybe there'll be a french muslim be like you know that's just hyped you're in america and that's what they're telling you but that's actually not how it is and we're fine and this is just a small group of people so it it could be subjective uh for for different people but uh it's not an up my point was from the shitty it's not an obligation to have children you don't have it's not like if you don't have children you're sinning marriage is one thing having children is is another thing whereas for other faith communities they are you have to get married to have children well okay that that sounded bad the way i said it if you get married you have to also have children for us that's not the case you can get married and decide you and your wife not to have children and that's fine but there's nothing haram about that that's what i was trying did that answer the question that answers your question thank you uh why i don't subscribe to organ donation uh well there is technically a difference in the sharia definition of death and the clinical definition of death such that for the organs to be viable and to be taken out of you before you die if you're an organ donor there is a potential that they are taken out of you while the sharia says you are still alive in which case you know taking the organ out of you would be the cause of your death and because of that gray area i personally in my personal life fall back on the more conservative opinion in which it's not permissible you know i don't want that to happen to me uh but rather i would just you know want to be left to whatever allah wills um of course the modern bodies of phil you know i think they argued that no the the the difference is too is too subtle for it to actually amount to that type of scenario that i'm concerned about so that's that's why i personally don't follow it but just because i personally don't follow something it doesn't mean that people are obligated to because it's a difference of opinion uh i know you answered this before but could you go over islam's reconciliation between free will and predestination i'm still having trouble understanding but perhaps i'm making assumptions that are true of other faiths and not islam okay allah created us allah created the world in which he created us i.e the dimensions that confine us so we as as a creation we have to be in time we have to be in space uh we have to be in place we have to be so on and so forth allah is not like any of that allah is not like not even remotely near any of that kind of stuff allah is not confined by any type of dimension so there's allah outside of space and time and all of those things that we are are that are part of our reality and he's seeing us so there is no past present and future for allah it's just one thing so allah sees what we have done what we are doing and what we will do from one vantage point because nothing escapes allah's knowledge but we are on that line of time so i can remember what happened in the past i am cognizant of what's happening now but i have no idea what will happen in the future but allah sees what will happen in the future because there is no time with allah so from our perspective we are free because we are acting we are choosing to act this way but i cannot act unless allah allows me to act which is another part of our belief it does not mean that allah makes me act this way that i have an internal desire to act and then allah at that moment creates in me the ability to act and then i am able to act which means that i could want to do something and not be able to do it i could want to lift this car in front of me and i have the desire to lift the car and i go to live the car and nothing it's just too heavy and everyone laughs haha you thought you could lift the car but there are circumstances where adrenaline adrenaline kicks in and you know there's an accident god forbid or something and somebody go hamsa he said the story once about dr omar farooq they were together in jeddah and they they were driving in the road and there was a car accident and somebody was trapped so doctor omar because dr omar used to live in jeddah he used to be taught there for like 20 years or something and he said hamza come because dr ramo is much older than shaykh hamza come with me come with me and then you know at this point of this young man and he's looking at what are you going to do you know and he sees the man is trapped in the car and then dr omar he puts his hand under the car and he said hamza when i when i uh when i i'm gonna you know lift the car when i lift it you yank this person out and sheikh hamzah said he said well i saw this with my own eyes he said allahu akbar and then he lifted the car and then he she comes and dragged this person out behind for under the car now if i want at that moment from a theological point of view we're saying that at that moment allah created in dr almar that ability that power that strength to lift a car which usually in our normal course of life is impossible no one will be able to lift that car it's impossible that you could do that so those two things one that allah is outside of all these dimensions and two we cannot act unless allah creates in us the ability to act that is our theology which means that we are free to act keeping in mind in the back of our mind that not necessarily everything we want to do we will be given the power and ability to do so therefore we are free to act and therefore we will be judged based on our actions when we ask allah to forgive us for our sins and to accept our good deeds and to have mercy upon us but allah is not creating us it is not forcing us to act otherwise there would be no point to be judged i hope that makes sense um uh following my response on organ donation would also be an issue on the donation of organ or organ parts from one living person to another such as a kidney or part of the liver now that's different uh because that doesn't cause you death and as long as your doctor uh okayed you like you know parent wants to give a child a kidney or a relative that's that's fine that's that's a medical issue not an issue the people get possessed by jinns they can but you have to be very weak for that to happen because all of the basic things a muslim does on a day-to-day basis protects them from all of that reciting the fate praying um you know you're going to be safe from that in naked machinations of of satan are weak weak vis-a-vis the basic things that we do so if somebody's possessed by jin most likely they're a person that doesn't pray that doesn't fast that you know that's just like muslim kind of in name not always but usually that's what it means so yes it's theoretically possible that a person gets possessed by a jinn but highly highly unlikely what is the difference between teen clay and ard earth within the context of how allah created adam that's a very good question i think that ard is more general all of the earth you know the heavens and the earth and teen is specifically the the the dirt part the clay part of earth so i think one is general and one is specific well adam i'd have to maybe ruminate over that a little bit but that's that's what initially is coming to me now that's a good question that will definitely keep me occupied from now until friday inshallah because when allah says you know that he created us you know the heavens and the earth we would understand by that the oceans and the seas and land and the forests and all of that but the theme part is specific it's like the earth earth part like earth with a lowercase e so i think that the the is is i'm is is general and the teen is haas is specific from the last time you were going to follow up on the question if a woman can conduct in a cafe she can't a woman cannot conduct an attack has to be a man i did look that up i think i forgot maybe to no i did i said i would share it in the next time yeah so that is a condition for the the conducting of the nikkei no was that the question yeah that was the question actually i don't know if i looked it up i thought we look i thought we were asking about the witnesses in the nikkei the witnesses they have to be men conducting the naked i have to look it up i think we look i thought we were i was supposed to look up the witnesses yeah i know i remember someone asked if a woman could officiate in the car i don't think a woman can officiate in the cafe but i what i looked up was the witnesses i think maybe i forgot to look up the specific uh okay i'll make a note i i apologize i apologize anything else no the witnesses don't have to be from the bright side they can be from they can be any witnesses they just have to witness the marriage so that it's that it's considered public in the shadia so it doesn't have to be from somebody's side i think what ends up happening culturally is we have like somebody from the bride's side and somebody from the groom's side but it doesn't it can be anybody yeah so the witnesses in them in the neca have to be men that's what i looked up i didn't look up the officiating part or i didn't come across you know because we don't have an officiation of the wedding because wedding is it's always talked about it's transaction law it's just an offer and an accepting of the offer and in some cases a woman can marry herself she can offer herself in marriage uh if she's of a certain age so we don't have an officiate that's the problem with the question or the way that we phrase the question is that the way we do it here is that we go to the mosque and there's the imam and we kind of make it like a ceremony but that's us that's not necessarily the the the spirit of the of the marriage transaction so that's why i need to do a little bit of digging because there's no there's no person like that's articulated clearly as the officiate uh prima facie so i'll look specifically i promise i'll look at that for next time i apologize if i forgot to could ask a follow-up question with regards to creation sorry you were breaking up can you ask what could ask a follow-up question with regards to creation yeah go ahead so in uh i think allah mentions how he fashions adam in proportion uh breeds you know the ru into adam gives him hearing gives him sight and hearts does the quran ever go into how that process or the hadith how that process occurs because i feel like some people might have has anybody interpreted that process may be you know occurring over a long period of time or is it always interpreted as allah created adam in a moment with all these processes happening you know at one time no it did it did occur in time because the details of course from the hadith because the sahaba asked the prophet saddam muhammad sallam when when did you become a prophet and he said when adam was still between his clay state and before the soul was breathed into him meaning that adam was created as a physical form and then by allah taking from the earth earth with a lowercase e from our earth with the uppercase e taking the earth forming it into the physical body of adam but before life was put into adam so that would that plus the fact that we believe time with allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is different than the way we tally time on our earth that one day with allah is you know x thousand days on earth etc so yes it did take take time it did happen over time and then the soul was placed into adam alaihissalam and then they were in paradise and then they were expelled and placed on earth so that again that would have taken time is that what you're asking yeah or be because we don't we obviously believe that we're all descendants of adam that adam had no predecessor that he was the first um right yeah yeah and it was just curious to me because when i revisited this ayat with you know the human being fashion and proportions and sight being given and hearing being given and heart heart being given it almost sounded a lot like he's an evolution they obviously believe that these traits accumulated over time one by one uh well i mean that if i if if if i understand the verse correctly that you're referring to i believe that that's talking about as we were fashioned in our mother's wombs we are given you know sight and hearing and the different senses and things like that oh okay that actually makes a lot more sense but let's go back to the evolution thing for a second there are a couple of things that are important to remember before we begin to ask or or or or entertain what is islam what are we going to say about human evolution the first thing is that there was life on earth before human beings that we believe it so we believe that the jinn occupied earth before human beings we don't know how long that is or how long that lasted and we know that the jinn fought with one another and it was a bloody affair we also know that the jinn are like us in in the in the sense that they are created they are rational uh they procreate uh so there are some type of species that is related to us in the sense that they have those type of functions but they're different than us some of the aleman they say look all of these like neanderthal and all of these type those that's all jin stuff that people are discovering those are not human beings well we know they're not human beings but they're related but not really related the other thing uh to remember is that there are there is no linear established linear human evolution they know the gaps between the evolution that they talk about in western science are hundreds of millions of years that they're just drawing drawing a line between this and this and saying look this led to this how long is this line like 100 million years 10 million years so that doesn't really mean anything that's not real science that's just you know that's just you're just putting you're just connecting this dot to that dot so there's a lot of room for us to reconcile and to believe and to have no problem with all of these things that are discovered i think the problems are with the conclusions that people make that people want to aggressively defend just like the french and the republic and freedom and all of that and liberalism they aggressively want to defend this form of human evolution and they want it to mean certain things therefore there's no religion therefore there's no god therefore this is all man-made that's the stuff we'll be like well no why does this historic record have to lead to that conclusion we just have a different set of conclusions but we can reconcile the two so those are the things that i think are important to keep in mind yeah i agree because i feel like an underlying you know current behind the whole teaching of evolution is that we can explain our existence without god which i obviously believe to be false but yeah [Music] if a muslim couple go to the county and register a civil wedding and then exchange vows between themselves as muslims is that sufficient for nikah in the u.s i mean yeah if if a muslim man and a muslim woman go to the local county and get married civilly the sharia would say that these two are married the sharia acknowledges that that marriage um there's nothing in that that violates our marriage conduct or anything like that but we we we do the nikkei as a ceremony you know as a religious ceremony to revive the sunnah to keep with the sunnah and and things like that and and what would be best is is if the mosque had the authority within it to conduct that civil marriage or sign those documents on be you know for the couple so that that both are done at the same time so there's so and i think we do that uh or the the cast that i have done have been like that but yeah it would be recognized by the shadia yeah when i was in dayton ohio about i'm talking about 15 years ago there's a conference about the previous question uh uh the human evolution and all those things millions of years of history finding the question was posted then the answer i heard about the explanation of the ayat of the quran that when allah wanted to create the other salam that the question was are you going to create those who will create the facade on the face of the heart the the answer was there was a creation called name bain they also used to be intellect and live on the face of the earth before even before the gene but after that i did some research but i could not find anywhere about the pain do you did you have any finding anything did you hear anything like that yes this is the the verse in surat al-baqarah yes on earth and then the angels responded are you going to create on earth that which will kill and create mischief and fitna and all of this and then allah says i know and and we worship you you know what there's no need to do this creation we worship you allah says i know and you do not know. so this verse in surat al-baqarah is a reference to this the details of that you probably will find in the history of the tabari and in eben kefirs bidet that's where i would would go i'm not my understanding is that they were jinn that were created i do not recall the names of them but that's where i would start to look in ibm uh and yeah and the video of ibn ketir i'll i'll try to look into it as well and the next time if i find something i'll bring it up anything else okay i hope uh i hope i answered some of these questions to everyone's satisfaction uh um so i guess we'll just keep going with this trend insha'allah announce the next one for december ask allah subhanahu ta'ala to keep us safe uh to forgive us for our shortcomings we ask allah to have mercy on all of our brothers and sisters who have passed before us we ask allah ta'ala for his mercy and forgiveness of for our parents we ask to protect our children from all harm in this world and the next ask allah to help keep our community safe during this difficult times we ask allah to make this gathering a gathering which is pleasing to him a gathering of remembrance such that it is in our scale of good deeds and may be a cause for us to enter paradise all of us together in sha allah [Music] [Music] foreign you
