evening to bless us in these moments in this hour we ask allah to make this a gathering of knowledge such that the angels descend upon us with their mercy may this be a gathering that will insha allah be in our scale of good deeds and may we approach this with an open heart and may allah guide us to the right answers to that which is pleasing to him and his prophet as is our custom i have a list here of confidential questions in the sense that i i don't know who who's asked these questions uh all i know is that they're somehow related to our community i assume and therefore there is no bias in when i read them or no breaching of confidences or anything like that i will i have 25 questions uh i will go through them there are some that are related so it won't actually be 25 and if there are things that are not clear or if people want to ask follow-up you can put them in the chat but i'm really not going to look at at the chat box until i finish the questions i have in front of me so we begin in sha allah question number one can can a sister abandon her 60 year old brother sorry can a sister abandon her 60 year old younger brother she tried to maintain siratul rahim with him by helping him find a job with no hope she even supports him with monthly payment and sending him food on a weekly basis although he is very healthy and very able to work but very lazy to do so he in turn doesn't appreciate what she does does and he is warning her all the time and is threatening her when sometimes she can't afford to support him because she also has other dependents she has taken care of please advise so there are with these type of questions there's a few things there's a few handicaps in the beginning obviously all i know is what was in the question so i i'm not i'm i don't know the details of this relationship i'm not going to get into it the second thing is when we answer a question like this we want to always distinguish between the halal and haram which is a very important criteria for us of course and also what is what is optimal because we know that there is more than just simply the halal and the haram from the haram the sister is not obligated to to care for the brothers the brother does not fall into the the bucket of the sisters obligation it's the opposite it's the brother who is supposed to look after the sister if there is no father or the sister is not married and a few sessions ago i believe it was a few sessions ago somebody asked a question about inheritance about men and women inheriting and i when i tried to answer that question i tried to highlight that one of the important things in understanding the distribution of the inheritance and what may appear to us as inequalities between the genders and inheritance is exactly what we're talking about here which is that the inheritance is also tied to the level of obligation so in this case it's not the sister who is obligated to take look after the brother it is the brother who is obligated to look after the sister that's from the point of view of the haram so whatever this sister has done has gone way beyond her obligations now you know none of us want to leave somebody uh stranded so that's the beyond the halal and the haram if there were a way that we can cleverly still you know make sure that this person is not destitute and you know not not left on the streets that would be good and that would be from the kindness of your heart but because there is this resistance from the the brother we need to find a way to do that this would be my advice such that he is essentially working for that assistance in other words he's not just sitting receiving it but he's working for it since he's the questioner said he's healthy and able and therefore if we tie that type of assistance maybe we can camouflage it through a charity or something like that but if he's working for it then hopefully that will help improve his state uh slightly again it's not an obligation because the you know the sister here is beyond beyond the obligation question number two should women cover their heels by wearing socks should one cover one's fingers too please explain that some women do wear socks some others do not some expose their hands and fingers and others do not the aura the nakedness of the woman that needs to be covered is everything except the face and the hands and imam abu hanifa adds the feet so in the hanafi medhab the feet are not an aura and that's why some women pray without socks and for the other schools the foot of the woman is the aura so she would wear socks and this is a difference of opinions so that women can you know feel free to follow what other opinion they need to uh you know whatever is compatible to them but there you don't have to cover your hands and at all and fingers it's not something that needs to be covered other than some women wear gloves uh because of the tan you know if if you're in the sun in the summer and you're out and about you don't want like your hand to be overly tanned more than your arm when you take off your clothes so i think people do it for a stylistic point of view but there's no sharia involved in that whatsoever the next question i would like to know if a muslim woman sorry i would like to know if a muslim person can donate her organs after she dies my friend recently had severe liver disease and within days deteriorated badly she was admitted to a hospital it was decided she needed liver transplant and if the hospital couldn't find a donor in 24 hours survival chances were very slim we as her friends all started praying for a miracle she was fortunate to find a donor at the right time then the question became why don't we donate our organs to help others 10 of my friends are ready to be registered donors through the mva but i think the quran says you take your organs with you when you die so could you please clarify on this subject thank you so much your sessions are very educated okay so the donor organ donors we've answered this before most of the bodies the international bodies allow owner donor sorry uh most fake bodies allow organ donation uh there there are other opinions that are more conservative that do not allow organ donation and i subscribe to the more conservative quest the more conservative position later in the question somebody asks the specific questions i'll just jump to that someone asked what's the difference between clinical death uh and sharia death and this is this distinguishes where the conservative opinion on organ donation comes from there is a possibility that there is a discrepancy between the two definitions of death such that before you actually die your organs are taken from the body in order for the organ to be used and therefore donated to in this case somebody else which could create a sharia technicality in which you might be the cause of your own death because the organ was removed while you are still alive from the sharia point of view and it's an academic distinction but most bodies as i said uh international film bodies have looked beyond this issue and have allowed organ donation i i am not an organ donor and i am happy to to follow that position because i think uh it is more compatible with you know the spirit of the quran that allah has honored the human being uh and whatnot but it is a difference of opinion and if you want to be an organ donor uh you certainly can question number four what activities constitute prohibited gambling in the sharia is the stock and bond markets gambling so stocks is not gambling because this is a form of finance you're buying equity into a company uh the company is performing it's you know theoretically it's uh financials are transparent its operations are transparent and you are investing into the company and then you are rewarded uh for that investment so that's not gambling although sometimes when you watch the stock market go up and down you know you think like it's gambling but it's it's a form of finance and investment gambling is is when you don't know what's going to happen i put money down on a horse race or i put money down on a football game or i put money down on a basketball game and i've done really no effort and anything it's completely based on chance so that money is taken and in the gambling transaction one party is going to win all the other party is going to lose all and uh you know we know what those things are you know casino games betting on sporting activities etc that's that's the broad definition of gambling so stocks stocks is not gambling of course because it's a form of investment you can lose money but you still have that equity in the company if you have like 10 shares and the acme company and then the share goes down you still have those shares if you wait they're going to go back up and then you can sell them again so it's it's a it's a transaction i'm not i'm not dishing out financial advice we're just talking about the haram what is your advice on how we should select proper entertainment for consumption from the islamic perspective tv movies music etc uh look you have to understand that that this is a broader issue it's the issue of culture and how we consume culture now we are part of this culture uh wherever we are whether we you know unbeknownst to us you know we're obviously a product of the culture that we are in and one of the things that is important to be able to train yourself to do is to how to look at the popular culture critically and to be able to read into the things that you are consuming the broader implications in society so rather than be concerned should i watch this show or should i watch that show can i watch this show up until season three and then after season three it gets bad i gotta fight rather than answering it like that i i want us to rise above that and i want us to be able to take and to critique uh you know not that i'm the example or or anything but uh sometimes when my when my kids play uh you know popular songs or something like that if i hear something in the lyrics i'll i'll comment not in a way that you know makes them feel oh you know that is being boring but i'll say oh you know this this reminds me of like this hadith or this is similar to this statement in the quran or or or this or that and i think the ability to find those ties and those points of union and also the points of disunion in which you can critique i think is very important because what we consume from an entertainment point of view this is essentially an indication of where the dominant culture is going to go whether it be in the literature that we read i mean i know hardly anyone reads anymore but but people that read literature uh people that uh are watching what's in the cinema uh people that are looking at of course popular music which is even more rapid than the other things that i mentioned these are really indications of what will become more popular and what will become more of a mainstay and it's important for us to know those things one of the things that they teach us when we study sharia is they say that the mufti has to know essentially everything so everything in life will be a source of information and knowledge for the mufti because to be able to cast a ruling on something or opine on a shariah ruling on something you have to know the context of that thing so from that point of view i mean i know this is a little bit sophisticated a little bit academic answer but it's important that we develop those skills that being said there are many many options that are out there and one of the options that i found recently that i like very much is a platform called alchemia i even interviewed the the founder of kimi on the podcast i can't remember the episode right now i think maybe a couple months ago but alchemia is a like netflix-like platform that has islamic themed shows dramas movies documentaries and you know i openly recommend it everyone in our community can afford to get a yearly subscription i think the yearly scripture subscription is like 40 50 bucks i think it's very generous and uh it has you know hundreds and hundreds of hours of of content so mix up your your your consumption with something from that and a lot of the shows even if they're in foreign languages they have subtitles they're very well done and you know i recommend that that highly as an option can a woman officiate an islamic wedding if not why not so we don't officiate weddings and and sometimes this is where sometimes we're disconnected with our own tradition there's no officiating of the wedding in islam there's no priest uh uh imam figure that officiates the wedding the way a marriage is a contract and as in any contract there is an offer and there is an acceptance of that offer with very specific words and that makes the happen and therefore it makes the marriage you know legitimate and and halal usually the mm is there to help facilitate that contract but do not think that the imam's role is somehow some magical spiritual role to officiate we don't have an officiation of the wedding so when i when i when i'm called to to do the necaf for somebody i'm just i'm basically i'm coaching the the husband-to-be and the guardian of the wife of the sorry the guardian of the bride i'm facilitating the words that are used in this contract so they don't mess up so that the contract is legitimate that's it but i i'm not like a magic person that i have come and i've like blessed the union or something like that so we don't officiate weddings there's no officiation of the weddings in muslim majority countries there is there is somebody who has been granted permission by the state permission by the magistrate to conduct and facilitate those weddings exactly in the way that i said to usually the person has a sharia background because it is a sharia contract and you need to understand what is to be said and things like that so there's no officiating in the wedding so therefore it's not a it's not an issue of men or women officiating the orbit however the next question which is related is why can't women be witnesses in islamic wedding what is the source of the ruling this is actually a difference of opinion the majority of the scholars say that the two witnesses have to be men and this goes back to the hadith of isha narrated by said islam let the two witnesses be upright two upright men so the words that she used in the hadith that she's narrating on behalf of the prophet sallam is that the witnesses are men it's a pretty standard hadith so the malikis the shafais and the hamballis they take that imam the the hanafis they argued slightly different they understood the text slightly different and they allow the witnesses to be it could be one man and two women however most of the muslim majority countries well i don't want to say that i don't know but my assumption that the ones that i know the muslim majority countries i know do not take that opinion even though it's a valid hanafi position and that's the position that i take as well there's no there's no need for that uh it's it would be very uncommon to do that even though it would be permissible according to the hanafi school uh so the answer the question why is it two men because that's the text of the hadith and there are some verses that that attest to that this relates to another issue altogether that even if you follow the hanafi position why is it one man and two women why can it be four women or why can it just be two women and then you get into this whole issue of why is a man's testimony uh or why is a women's you know in testimony it's one man and two women as is mentioned in the verse of surah al-baqarah this is a long a larger subject but just sort of to highlight it because it's related to the question there's a difference between narration and testimony oftentimes we forget so when we find these controversial or or misunderstood let me say issues in islam we need to sort of gather all of the things that are related together to have a a realistic and honest picture of what we're dealing with narration riwaya is i'm narrating a hadith to you or i'm narrating the quran to you or i am narrating some piece of information that has happened in the narration there is no there is no difference between men and women anybody can narrate the religion which which if you think about it is more important than these you know court testimony situations women narrate the hadith and a woman's narration of the hadith is just as equal to a man's narration as a matter of fact we know of no women who narrated hadith that were weak there were weak men narrators and strong men narrators but all of the women who narrated hadith were all reliable so same thing that goes with the quran that's narration when it comes to testimony testimony is about something specific not something that is general and because it is about something specific related to that will be implications in the court so if i testify that i took you know that i saw uh brother mohsin give a hundred dollars to you know brother sultan then i've now made something very specific and i've linked myself to that situation one of them can now hold me accountable in court because i was a a witness to that type of transaction and i can get dragged into that type of litigation so to free the burden of litigation from women allah in in those situations and by the way it's only specific situations is the woman's testimony there's going to be two to one man to lessen the burden that might have to be on her in the case of litigation but there are situations in which a woman's testimony is equal to a man's testimony and there are situations in which a woman's testimony is accepted and a man's testimony is not accepted at all so it's only in the situations of business transactions where there's the two to the one in the case of marriage which is a new a new one that i discovered i was preparing for this question but in matters that are related to women and childbirth and things like that a woman's testimony will be accepted over a man's testimony won't even be accepted because it's not something that they would be familiar with so just i flag that because it's related similar but not related to the issue i hope inshallah that was clear okay question eight should we break fast at the beginning of the then of more after finishing the event in order for the event to be permissible and to count the time has to already come before the recites the hamza of allah allah al that has to fall in the time of the prayer so when the things used to be trained there was something that the mu'edin would do which is called temkeen in which they would would guarantee that the time has come the actual prayer time has come in and then they allah so when you hear the then that means the time has come in uh otherwise that then is not valid you don't have to wait to the end so this is not just for breaking your fast but this goes to uh prayers you know all the five prayers so we hope insha allah as we train a new generation of of young scholars and stuff that people that learn phil need to also learn this concept of tim king's own the mosque and you know they're reciting that then that people are comforted that the minute they begin that means that time has already entered and therefore you can break your fast prophet muhammad sallallahu salaam used to fast mondays and thursdays i heard in one of your lectures that the prophet sasam got revelation on monday and was born on monday what is the importance of thursday that he used to fast sallallahu the prophet saw he was asked about fasting on monday and he said this is a day in which i was born so he fasted every monday as a thanksgiving and as a celebration of his own birth and then in the other hadith he also fasted on monday and thursdays and he was asked why and he said because on mondays and thursdays our our actions are presented to allah subhanahu ta'ala and i like that my actions be presented to allah while i'm in a state of fasting so that's the reason behind the fast on monday and thursday sallallahu okay when we read three rakats of witcher prayer do we have to sit after two read the tahit and get up for the third or have we to read continuously three rakats so the witter prayer there are three ways to pray it there are meaning there are three ways that the prophet salallahu he used to pray exactly like prayer three rakaats in the second raqqa you say the tahit you stand and in the third rakah you say the tahyat and then you do one salaam i mean salaam on the right and the left another way the prophet saws prayed is to pray the three rakaas without sitting in the second raqqa so it's three straight rakaas but not sitting in the second raqqa and the third way the prophet sallallahu assalam used to pray is to pray two saddam salaam and then pray one and that's the way we pray it in the masjid but they're all based on different narrations and and they're all sunnah they're all the sunnah of the prophet sallallahu alaihi now i've been in a mosque before where the imam i think he's trying to teach the congregation that there are different ways but he never communicated it so every night in ramadan he's praying taraweeh and you don't know what's going on so if you know there also has to be some hikima in in the situation so uh i mean it got very confusing so if we were to do this in the mosque for example like if anas was going to lead us in in taraweeh this ramadan inshallah and he wanted to you know do the the with the different ways then we would have to announce it before we do it or else people are going to be going up and down and left and right and not knowing what's going they're going to be bumping into each other and we'll make a whole mess of the witter prayer and then i'll get a whole flood of questions as the winter count i have to pray with it again and things like that so in your own in your own business you can pray the different ways you but if you're going to pray in congregation be sure you communicate to the congregants what's going on okay question 11 i am a woman in my mid to late 40s for the past several months i get spotting for 10 days before my actual menstrual cycle begins which lasts for 5 to 7 days this leaves 15 days in which i can in which i possibly can't pray or read the quran or fast please advise me on what i can or can't do when i am spotting in terms of ibeda and what i should do to deal with this ramadan is coming and i don't want to miss too many days of fasting if possible also it brings me a lot of peace when i'm able to read the holy quran and it's hard to miss that so much okay this is an awesome question as an opportunity for us to learn some fic so in menstruation is a is a difficult uh section in phil because well one i'm a man so you know i'm i have to uh you know consult with a woman to make sure i understand what's going on so i don't experience it and number two it is confusing because it's it's not it doesn't work like clockwork you know you read something in the book and then you live something else like the person asking the question so to make it easy this is what you need to know about menstruation the smallest so the shortest amount of menstrual a menstrual cycle can be is 24 hours that's rule number one the longest a menstruation cycle can be is 15 days that's rule number two rule number three is that the time between the two menstruation cycles is not going to be less than 15 days based on that we can start to answer the question so i start spotting today and i know that the spotting is menstrual spotting that means that at the moment i start spotting my menstrual cycle starts and i know that the minimum that it could be is 24 hours so i have to wait till tomorrow the same time to see if i stop or not but tomorrow i have more spotting and then i stop spotting for half a day and then some spotting and then no spotting and then some all of this is your menstrual cycle until you go from the first day till day 15. what happens one moment after the 15 days it's no longer considered the menstrual cycle in the sharia it's not considered al it's called an istahada it's something else even though it might look the same and you might feel the same in all of that but the sharia says no at 15 days the cycle ends so one moment one minute after 15 days even if you're still bleeding you know that rule number two the maximum the cycle can be is 15 days khalas it's not menstrual cycle you make your host and you resume your ibeda so it sounds like from the questioner that you need to back add the days of spotting those are your menstrual cycle you said i think i get spotting for 10 days before the actual cycle that those the spotting is your cycle and then you go you said your cycle is usually five to seven days if you add five days to those 10 that's 15 period days 16 and day 17 those are istahada days those are days of not menstruation but istahada and therefore you can make russell and and pray as far as the quran is concerned remember we talked about this before i think we talked about this before that what is impermissible for the the menstruating woman is the recitation of the quran which means to say it out loud but if you were to read your quran like on your phone you know or listen to it all of that's not considered recitation so as a general rule nothing should block you from having a relationship with the quran so anytime you think that you can't access the quran then something's gone awry in in your thinking or my thinking there's there's all listening to it listening to it is not reciting it so you can listen to it i'm gonna listen to it you know uh continuously on the phone when i'm when i have my period so i don't miss my jews in ramadan that's fine there's nothing there's nothing wrong with that so there are these you know sharia i call them sharia loopholes but nothing should prevent us from having a relationship with the quran i would like to know uh more about the notion of kareem is it bad or good does everyone have an appointed kareem what is the purpose of the hari the is the the angel uh or the um well there's the angel that is with us that write down our deeds and then the kareem is a jinn that can be around us and can either encourage us to do good or encourage us to do bad and then the prophet saw him said he said i had a kareem but he became muslim and he only encourages me to do good that's really all you need to know about it and it's just something that you believe in and that's in the unseen but i wouldn't get too hung up about it and start blaming the kareem for all your problems and you know the the kareem ate my homework and the kharim made me get divorced and you know we're responsible for our own actions and allah does not give us something except that he us with more than what we can bear so we are responsible for our own actions etc can you expand on the difference between today's medical definition of death and death in islam death in islam as i said before is is like you're dead there's no pulse there's no heart you're gone the the soul has gone out of your body it's etc clinical death could be a few moments before that in in which the body you know you're clinically dead the heart stopped but there's still stuff happening uh so you know it could be a matter of moments or or could be a matter of minutes that there could be a discrepancy between the two can you please expand on why we should not be organ donors and why we answer that question organ don't answer uh i'm memorizing the 99 names of allah and was wondering why yes are not part of the 99 and then the follow-up question to that is who compiled the 99 names my understanding is that all 99 names are in the quran in the quran remember that the hadith that we went over for the 99 names is just one narration of hadith narrated by abu hurairah of the 99 names but that same hadith has three narrations each narration have slightly different names furthermore not all of the names of allah in the quran and in the hadith in the quran all of the names that people have gathered in the quran are about 250 and all of the names of allah gathered in the sunnah tradition are about 160 and if you subtract out those that are duplicate we have in the quran and the sunnah about 220 names 99 have been specified in that one hadith keeping in mind that in that same hadith in the other narrations of etirmiti there are other names that are not mentioned so that's why you did not you did not find it and and they're all allah's divine names okay 18. is it bidad to recite ayat karima multiple times 100 200 12 400 is there a hadith which supports this growing up in the indian subcontinent above was part of life and a prevalent part of the culture there's absolutely nothing haram with this and the sahaba engaged in their own itchy head and and recited things different times many times how can reciting the quran more be bitter just think about that how could reciting a surah or a verse in the quran multiple times be haram you're reciting the quran some of the sahaba they would repeat the same surah over and over again because they were they were they it spoke to them you know that's how we would say it spoke to them and the prophet saws and praised that there is nothing haram or bida whatsoever in reciting the quran x number of times or versus x number of times or saying x number x number of times this idea that that's a notion that's that's one of the plagues that you know that affect the muslim consciousness today and the reason you grew up like that is because you grew up in a good time and now we live in a bad time and now people say oh this is bid and that's bidah and if we revive these things it will be a good time again so there's nothing haram or even remotely biddah this is the heart of the quran and the sunnah uh you know allah says openly to allah belongs the great names call him by those names okay so call him with whatever with that whatever you want the quran says that it is that it is a healing so you recite these verses over and over what's wrong with that nothing is wrong with that whatsoever if you are going out and it is not the her time can you do the prayer a little early like 15 minutes before the actual event time and can we do any prayer later if you miss fajr can you do it at a later time okay so the first half of the question is you can't pray before the time has come in because the time coming in is a condition for the prayer to be valid so no you cannot pray before the time what happens if you miss a prayer you have to make the prayer up not can i make the prayer you have to pray the prayer you have to make that prayer up when you pray a prayer late outside of its time it's called khada make up when you pray the prayer in its time it's called ade meaning that you did the prayer in the right time if people are having trouble with the the prayer remember that you can combine your duhran asar in either time and you can combine merba in either time and then that way you can avoid any problems inshallah coming towards the end just a few more if we do we do and wear socks for the next prayer is it okay to leave the socks on while doing wudu and not wash the feet again if you put your socks on you after you have made wudu when you go and you break your wudu and then you want to make wudu again in order to wipe over the sock the sock has has to remain on you and has to cover from your toes up and above your ankles as long as you place those socks with those conditions on you in a state of wudu if you want to wipe over them they must be worn continuously and then you can wipe over them now you don't have to take them off again but if you take them off or if you take one off and you forget you've lost that you have to you have to make a full do by washing your feet uh if i go to the toilet for we do and urine drops on my pants by accident should i change my pants this is a common occurrence in the office no you you can sprinkle water over the affected area and that will insha allah solve that if we're praying at home as a family and we ask my son of 12 years to lead the prayer to encourage him is this prayer by the group acceptable as he is a minor yeah as long as he prays correctly if one converts to islam should one adopt an islamic sounding name a friend of mine is marrying a convert and her father insists that the husband should change his name is there anything called an islamic name no there's no nothing called an islamic name the prophet only changed few names of the people who became muslim and the reason he changed those names is like some guy's name was war or some guy's name was abdul shems you know the the the slave or the servant of the son he's like no you're abdullah you're not harabor you know jameel or something like that but he think about it none of the sahabah changed their names they just had normal arab names because that was normal at the time but if one of the sahabah was name was steve the prophet most likely would have just been okay you're you're steve why because there's nothing wrong with that name so the only name change that is required is if like your name is like a curse word or something or like it's like a really grotesque name that's so that's we one of the rights that we have as children is that our parents give us a good name a beautiful name as long as your name means something good then that's fine and i'm not i i do not support the name change uh thing because we lose that spirit we lose that understanding it's not the sunnah to do that i know that some people they have like the zeal when they become muslim and they want to like become arab eyes and things like that but there's no reason to do that there's nothing haram with your name as long as your name means something good so there's no obligation to do that nor does in this case do they have to comply with the father-in-law's wishes okay those are the questions that i got i see there's some activity in the chat okay question number one is about is nail polish permissible of course nail polish for women i'm assuming nail polish is permissible i think maybe the issue is the issue of wudu so if you put polish on your nails and the water cannot penetrate the nail then you now have a a you have you have a substance that can block the water from penetrating that which needs to be washed for the purposes of wadu and that's and this is where the whole idea of breathable nail polish has emerged and there are many uh breathable nail polish brands i've tested a few of them whatever i found in my house that my wife uses i've tested a few of them and the ones that my wife use seem to are in fact breathable and therefore you know i tell her comfortably you should feel free to wear them and make wudu over them uh many muslim women will put their nail polish on when their period starts uh and they sort of these are like cultural expressions uh or they'll put their nail polish on at night if they're going out to like a party or something like that because there's no more prayers until the next morning and things like that but the bottom line is if you if you have something on your nails that blocks the water from penetrating the nail then you're not able to make wudu fully and then that's a problem you have to remove the nail polish in order to make wood but as as nail polish is it permissible it's permissible does changing a baby's diaper nullify your wudu not no not as long as you don't touch the private part of the baby if you try to the private part of the baby you lose your wood okay a little bit longer question is about euthanasia for an animal who's terminally ill uh i would go with what the doctor recommends what with what the vet recommends um because i i have had a pet uh that when i was younger either went crazy or something i mean it was really bad you had to get rid of the the animals so having experienced that i would say that i would go with what the uh with what the vet says if the vet recommends it then i would i would do it but please do not apply this to human beings okay any other questions or if if there were any of the questions that i answered that were maybe a little complicated that people didn't get the answers to they want some clarification speak now or forever hold your peace so just based on the names on the zoom call i am noticing an increase of sisters now it could be that you know the guys are just logging on with their wives account but it also could be that sisters are just more interested in this stuff than men so i'm i'm interested to see what happens when we go back to the mosque women traveling alone for higher education is fine as long as the travel is safe it's permissible the the prohibition of women traveling without a mahram is based on is contingent on the traveling not being safe but the prophet saw said a time will come where a woman a woman can travel from here meaning arabia to sana'a to the capital of yemen and not have anything to fear meaning that that the prohibition is contingent so people that say that they don't understand how to read the hadith so there's not as long as this travel is safe then it's safe uh not clear about nail polish and wudu okay so you know i'm wearing this this sleeve is on my arm so if i want to make wudu i have to undo my cuff and you know roll up my sleeve to wash my my arm i can't i can't just pour the water over over this fabric because it will block the water from reaching my skin so what needs to be washed for the wadu to be compliant when it comes to the arm it's from the elbow all the way to the fingertip including the fingernails the fingernails need to get wet for the to be valid so if i'm wearing nail polish and the nail polish does not allow the water to penetrate the nail then i have my wudu is incomplete that's the issue of nail polish and will do and whatnot so there are several ways around that one way around that is to use breathable nail polish and and as i've said i've tested at least the ones that my wife has at home and i think two out of the three were fine another option is that some muslim women before the advent of the the breathable nail polish it would be common that muslim women would only wear nail polish when they have their period because they don't have to worry about wudu in prayer or they would wear nail polish in the evening if they were going out to a function because you know you finished your eyeshadow prayer and then you don't have to wipe take you can take your nail polish off before the next the next day etc okay when can a woman be an imam if by imam we mean religious leader and teacher since the time of the prophet i saw him say isha was a mufti and not only a mufti but she taught a whole generation of the young sahaba and the the the older te bering they all learned their half of our deen comes from so from the point of view of of a muslim woman becoming learned and a teacher and die it's there's no prohibition i've mentioned many times i would be thrilled on friday if the bayern was given by a woman and i just stood up and i did the liturgical stuff for like two minutes there's nothing wrong with that at all nor is that even odd there were muslim scholars all throughout islamic history from every walks of life there's absolutely nothing wrong with it if we're talking about a woman leading the prayer that's different because that's the one of the conditions of that is that the leader of the prayer be a man the juma prayer leader be a man a man etc based on the hadith and the and the quranic verses etc but that doesn't mean that should not in any way thwart the ability for a woman to teach i have women that study with me i hope the reason i'm teaching them is that one day they will go teach others so there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever and that that's a barrier that doesn't even exist in islam we shouldn't even think about it if your doctor says you will need an organ transplant what will you do except well it depends it depends on the state i'm in i i mean if you're asking me personally i mean i i it depends you know if i'm dying i'm dying uh you know but i i mean i don't know honestly i don't know how to answer that question i don't know what i would do imam here is a leader of a mixed congregation prayer you know if we're talking about leading the salah leading the namaz that has to be a man a woman can be the imam or the leader of the prayer if it's if it's all women women can lead a woman's lead congregation but if the congregation is men or mixed then the condition of the imam is it has to be the the condition is that the imam has to be a man at the prophet saw he said so pray the way you have seen me pray there was no women that were the imams of the congregation that were mixed is investing in bank shares halal it's investing if the bank is public or it has shares and you're buying equity into the bank is an investment machine you know the bank takes your money and mining your money and other monies and things like that and it invests it in mega projects the bank is not a vault in which money is you know put in cubbies and it's not what a bank is a bank is a is a mechanism for finance and investing and the bank makes a profit or else you know it wouldn't work so investing in a bank or shares in a bank is just like investing in a uh in a company you know as long as it's not like a bank that you know makes poison that kills people and things like that but in for regular in regular situations nothing wrong with that at iccp when we pray mixed with men in front and women behind and women can see the men is this okay yeah there's there's no prohibition of of um you know seeing one another in the mosque that's not like a problem uh as long as everyone is praying where they're supposed to be pray and as i've mentioned before there was no barrier in the time of the prophet i saw salaam i mean it was just sort of one hall and people just prayed when they had to pray so there's nothing there's nothing wrong with that nor is there anything wrong with with our hall where where there's really and we have a little barrier just so the men don't encroach on the women's section that's more for like logistical purpose we don't have like a wall or like or or a curtain or something like that nor should there be or or or nor need needs there to be one only if the women for some reason want to be you know not seen for if you're a woman has a child or something like that that's a difference you know those are more case by case but as a general there's nothing there's nothing wrong with that you know if you look at any of the ancient mosques that we have throughout the muslim world you know the mosques from the early generation there's no barrier there's no men's section women's section it's just a big space and people just set up when they have to pray you know because many of these mosques were also learning institutes places of learning so there are also madrasas at the same time so people used to sit together okay i'll take these last two questions and then we can end what about the bank business that involves loaning out money with fixed interest isn't that ribber no interest is not ribba as we've said many times interest is something else and there's no ribba in paper money according to the later generation of the shafi medhabs and that's the opinion that's most compatible with our current day and age so you know all banks are going to lend out money at some point and and deal with interest and and we are saying that that's not haram uh why did the sunni schools say triple divorce counts as three when there's a hadith saying that the prophet saws encountered triple divorce as one because of the weakness of the hadith of rokhana and so even though that position exists and and ibn tamiya argued that position and most personal status law in muslim majority countries take that position and standardize it it's it's there's a weakness in the hadith transmission it's not as strong as the other other hadith even though ibn tamiya makes the effort to show that it's a reliable hadith it's still he's in a minority position in addition the enormity of the or the seriousness of the divorce act for a man to say you are divorced and to associate a number with it most of the schools they'll take that number and count it which which has created a lot of problems so they try to find sharia solutions to it if a child is crying and disturbs those praying should the mom stop praying and take the child out as they are disturbed well she doesn't have to necessarily leave the prayer she can just pick up the child if that will quiet the child but if the child is like screaming its lungs off yeah i would get out of the prayer you know and take the child out absolutely can you wean a child if you find it difficult to fast while breastfeeding well don't harm the child if you are able to breastfeed the child it's better it's more healthy more natural and there's a lot of benefit you know also spiritual benefit in that so don't not breastfeed your child because of the fasting you have a dispensation and you can make up your fasting but if the child is not latching on properly or you're not producing enough milk or you know the child is just sort of weaning itself often that's okay that's fine but i'm just this is a preference you can it's not haram to to do what you're saying but i wouldn't do that it's a you know breastfeeding your child not that i have any personal experience but breastfeeding your child is a unique once in a lifetime opportunity you can only breastfeed your each child for x number of months anyway so don't don't squander away that uh that opportunity wallahi i hope this was beneficial uh i'm glad that we have this opportunity for the questions i appreciate you guys giving me these questions because it keeps you on my toes and i get to look things up things that i forgot or things that i don't know and things like that and i always get to look smart in front of you so thank you for that opportunity although i did spend quite a bit of the afternoon looking up some of the questions in all honesty but thank you for the opportunity i hope it's beneficial and i believe we will have one more session before ramadan because the april session will be before ramadan we might skip may but we'll definitely have one more before ramadan so maybe we can ask and answer more questions focused on uh fasting and ramadan inshaallah but as as you all know my weekly classes are open as well so if we didn't get to something today please feel free to mention it on friday okay you
