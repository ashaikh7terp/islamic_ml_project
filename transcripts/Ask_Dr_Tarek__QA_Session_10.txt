welcome everyone to our open q a session i have about 20 questions that have been uh sent to me about 20 i have about 20 questions so we'll go down the questions if there are anything if there's anything that's not clear let me know in the chat if there are any other questions let me know so these are in no particular order and uh just to reiterate all of this is anonymous i don't know who's asked these questions okay the first question is i have tried to read i've tried reading the translation of tafsir ibn but it is very long and detailed i'm not really able to get through it i'm really interested in understanding the basics of what was happening during the time that various verses were revealed is there a shorter text in english that you would be able to recommend perhaps something higher level and more summarized well trying to read ibn kathir is like reading an entire encyclopedia i mean you don't read eben it's a reference work so i'm not surprised that you're having difficulty reading it maybe i had referenced in one of the previous uh questions that is one of the reliable tafsirs because it is tafsir that is based on more or less the hadith that are related on each verse so it's a hadith-based tafsir there are other tafasir there's cortobi there's these are all huge monumental 20 plus volume works so if you want something that's shorter that gives you a understanding i suggest the thematic tafsir of the quran by sheikh mohammed al-ghazali muhammad al-hazari is the modern egyptian he died like in the 80s not imam al-ghazali of the past a thematic i think it's called the thematic tafsir of the quran what he does is basically he takes every surah and he tells you in like a couple of pages this is the theme of the surah and a little bit of how it's kind of related to the chapter before in the chapter after that will give you a general idea if you want to look up specific verses and you want to know what why was this verse revealed or what was revealed about this verse even cathedral is going to be [Music] versus [Music] which is a very small tafsir that just basically explains every other word of the quran usually it's printed just on the margin of the mushaf that is translated in english that also sort of gives you a little bit of an understanding of what the verses mean so that's what i would try to do thematic tough seal of aquarium the second question when i'm reading quran do i need to recite in an audible voice and do the same rules apply for dick i find it hard to do dikka in an audible voice can things be recited in your heart and mind so when it comes to the recitation of the quran if you're reciting the quran in prayer then it has to be audible at least to yourself but if you are reciting the quran any other time or you're making vik any other time you don't have to be audible because all of this is a form of reading so if you're reading with the eyes or reading with the heart and the same thing applies with dick so whether the thick is silent as a matter of fact the real thick is the thicker of the heart not the dick of the tongue the dikkar of the tongue is to stimulate the heart to be in a state of remembrance so because you are sort of in control more of your your tongue and if you do that long enough then your heart starts doing it automatically so the real vic is the silent to start out with um so from that point of view there's no you don't have to do it out loud at all but as i said with the quran the more you engage your senses the more rewards you're going to get the more impact so if you see the the verse if you recite the verse and you hear the verse and you're holding the muslim in a way all of your senses are involved so that's like maximum level right that's the the highest level if you just recite it to yourself that's fine you can recite it to yourself but you're you're losing out on the opportunity to engage your other senses so sometimes there's a time for this sometimes there's a time for that if you are outside of the prayer my suggestion is that you do what you feel comfortable with where you find your heart because this is somewhat subjective to each person i would like to know if islamic law has rulings related to trade follows following demand and supply and what is the rule for an honest and fair margin of profit when an object is sold i'm asking these questions because we assist in some muslim countries and ra the rays of prices of commodities specifically during ramadan something like scalping well in general as a general concept as long as somebody agrees to buy an object from you or a service or a good and you offer a price and they agree to buy it at that price then the transaction is halal and then the profit is so if i want to uh you know sell a painting and i'm you know sell it for i bought it for a hundred dollars but i want to sell it for 10 million and somebody agrees to buy it for 10 million and that's fine there's nothing wrong with that where it can become haram is if you control uh essential resources or essential commodities and you artificially inflate the price beyond what is necessary that is haram that type of market manipulation or that type of monopoly is haram like if you have a monopoly on water and then you like raise the price of water for regular people things like that but in this case the reason the prices probably are increased in ramadan is because there's going to be a huge exponential demand on those goods and maybe the companies have you know they have a justification for that that there's more demand and therefore it's going to require more fuel or more uh more stress on the supply chain or something like that so those price increases are fine here we're just bit specifically or sorry strictly talking about halal and haram i'm not saying that this is a good thing to do or you should do this i'm saying it's not haram to do that but of course if muslims stop going crazy when ramadan starts and feel like they have to go buy everything from the store then there wouldn't be this problem to start out with if anything we're supposed to consume less in ramadan not more i don't know why the increase happens in ramadan because we've lost the spirit of ramadan so that's another angle to it but from the point of view of transaction law that's fine again as long as you aren't uh astronomically raising the price to the point that you are preventing people from having uh basic goods what are the components of the prayer from a shafi perspective for example is the is required what is the minimum required length of recitation after faith in the first two raka's i've heard everything from a single verse even letters like alif lameen to three verses well first of all there is no requirement to recite a surah after the fatah that's a sunnah so if we're talking about the stripped down version of the prayer according to the shafai method what is the quintessential components without which the prayer is not valid as you have to stand say allahu akbar recite the fatiha then say allahu akbar and just spend one moment in rakuwa without saying anything and then sami allah spending one moment standing erect and then saying allahu akbar spending one moment in sujood saying allahu akbar and sitting spending one moment sitting and then saying allah so on and so forth that's that's the stripped down version that's what's obligatory if you miss one of those little things the prayer is not valid but reciting a surah in the first and second rakah is only a sunnah it's not a it's not a foreign so you could you could recite only the fatah throughout all of the prayer and the prayer is fine so there's no minimum length so let's say i'm we're praying merib and i finished the faith i'm leading the prayer and i finished the faith and i say after that bismillah that's fine because i'm free to choose what i want but i wouldn't say uh after the fat bismuth allahu akbar because i didn't finish the verse you have to finish the verse so elif is a verse so you could say bismillah you wanted to or you could say nothing just say i mean maybe i'll do that one day to throw everyone off and see what happens okay but you don't have to it's just a sunnah again i'm not saying don't read the surah i'm just saying it's the sunnah we should read the surah we should do the extra works because why not we're standing praying anyway we might as well get the extra reward but from the point of view of the question what's the bare minimum it's what i described you don't even have to say subhana rabbi alvin subhana rabbi that's a sunnah but if you spend a moment in those positions so you make rakuwa and then you say semi allah that's fine such that an observer will say yeah that person made you goku it doesn't matter you don't have to say anything now of course none of us pray like that but i'm saying that's how the is constructed with the prayer uh actually in some in some uh muslim cultures in taraweeh they actually pray the taraweeh that way they'll they pray 20 raka's and then each raka after the fattah they recite one verse and then they they so they're 20 raka's of taraweeh it's like 10 minutes long so i've been in prayers like that maybe we should try it see what happens okay at the start of the pandemic i decided to close my business because of safety reasons but now i feel that i made a huge mistake and feel that i should have stuck it out and kept the business open and regret making that choice immensely was this a calamity punishment or a blessing for me actually i received this question prior uh privately and i answered it because we felt that it was of an urgent nature um and actually i forgot who asked it so for as as far as i'm concerned it's anonymous but let me answer it again for the benefit of everyone which is that we have to remember uh that first of all this pandemic sucked and sucks and continues to suck and there are many bad things that have happened there are huge economic uh ramifications many many people have gone out of business so the person saying that i had a business and i had to close it i mean i i closed the business during the pandemic every all small businesses have been affected so it's not like you're experiencing something new when it happens to you you feel like you're the only person in the world but rest assured that this is you know a global problem and some countries have been decimated economically because of of covet so i'm not saying this to belittle the problem i'm just saying that it's not something that's unique it's not like allah's wrath on you or something like that the other thing is when we pray as taharan we ask allah to guide us and we've been guided to a decision or we take a decision based on that we have to trust that that decision was based on allah's guidance and not second guess ourselves so you close the business khalas and that's what you were guided to don't go back and second guess yourself because you don't know and then maybe things rebounded and you say to yourself you know shaytaan plays with you oh if i had kept my business open i would have this that would have happened and that would have happened you don't know that because maybe allah prevented something worse from happening and that's the part of us being believers we do our best to estimate we do our best to have strategic thinking we do our best to project and all of that but at the end of the day we don't know we don't know what would have happened maybe something from left field could have happened uh and a bigger calamity could have could have occurred but by closing your business alhamdulillah you were that calamity was averted so don't give up hope trust in allah subhanahu wa ta'ala it's not a punishment from allah this is the sunna of life there are ups and there are downs and in both ups and both down we always turn to allah and that's why istahara is a very important tool because it teaches you to put your trust in your decision making with what allah has guided you because when in the istahara prayer you're asking allah subhanahu ta'ala to guide you in what's good in this world and the next so we don't want to be blind to just this world in spite of the next or forget this world and live for the next because you only get to the next world through this world and also there's another mentality that muslims have that they want to circumvent this life and they just want to live for the hereafter but we were meant for allah on earth we are meant to live in this life and there's a difference between the dunya and al there's a difference between the life of the life of this world and life itself so life is something that we cherish is something that we it is in this life that we come to know allah that we come to worship allah subhanahu wa so we must live fully in this life so we need this life and the hereafter and that's the point of this so when something like this happens remember the other perspective if iblees was expelled from jannah when he refused to make sajdah to adam then how was he present in the garden when adam slipped by eating from the tree who told you that iblis was in the garden at least was not in the garden but at least west wasa at least whispered time isn't at least whispering to us right now do we see him unless one of you is at least and i don't know right but that's that's the the the power given to at least by allah is he can whisper to mankind wherever they are and this is part of our creation allah created us this way and allah subhanahu ta'ala created adam as i just cited adam and eve of course for this world not for paradise that was the intent all along behind the creation of the human being so part of that package whether we like it or not is that we have to deal with shaitan and we have to deal with his whisperings so he did west wasab and what happened happened and adam didn't slip but both of them it was both of them both of them ate and both of them were expelled from the paradise onto earth is there any reason why most prophets we know of seem to originate from the levant and not other places like south america or china well again there are those are the mba that we know of that are named but of course we also believe that every people on every civilization were given mba and that's why we respect also other ancient religions and traditions and like when you look at all of that ancient egypt stuff all that phronic stuff there's there's a definitely a religion behind that i mean people didn't just sit sit one day let's be creative and build these pyramids and build no there's definitely involved with whatever they built i mean that has to be directed or influenced by the divine so all nations all all people have been sent uh so just so have a different perspective allah has chosen uh to uh in his infinite wisdom i mean ultimately why he chose these people to mention in the quran and not the others that i don't know but there is something about this area and the religious the the the abrahamic religious tradition that has a lasting and impactful has a global impact in a way that sometimes some of the other religious traditions don't but that's just me i don't i don't know the real answer to that question but remember that we respect and we acknowledge that there have been other prophets even if we don't know their names of the other great religions and remember also that allah has chosen these lands allah has chosen the shem and has blessed it he says we have taken the prophet saws from mecca to the furthest mosque around which we have blessed so allah has chosen this land to be blessed allah has chosen mecca to be the site of the house of allah subhanahu ta'ala beneath which there is a kaaba in the in the heavens so allah out of all of the earth chose this area this land mass and if you look at the ancient maps of the world they're not the way they are now we would say that they are upside down like with north america and south america all of that in the ancient maps it was all upside down and if you look at the map upside down arabia's there's nothing on top of arabia arabia is on the top and in the center of the globe so allah chose this area so there's no doubt that this area is not like manhattan or texas or panama allah chose this area and most likely because of that this is where the the focus is on the religious traditions and the prophets that we know but we do not negate that there have been other prophets since can you go over the difference between the skies and the heavens do each have seven layers and where is allah's course in relation everything that you see in space in the observable universe that's all the dunya all this heaven stuff that's something that you can't see so everything that you can observe the the largest uh imaging that we have of the known universe that's all the dunya or the first level of heavens on top of that are six more levels and the first level of heaven in comparison to the second level of heaven is as if you have cast a ring in the desert and the second level in relation to the third level is as if you have cast a ring in a desert and the third level in relation to the fourth level is as if you have cast a ring into the level all the way to the seventh level of heaven and the seventh level of heaven in comparison to the throne of allah as is if you have thrown a ring in a desert this is the hadith of the prophet saws so these are this is a space size that we cannot even fathom okay maybe you can do one or two but you can't fathom more than that so everything that's around us not just here and this planet but everything of the observable universe that's all the first level of heavens and then on top of that are other levels that we cannot see or we cannot perceive but we believe in them and that's why we say the lord of all the worlds not just one world not rabb remember he said i know there's like seven eight dozen i don't know how i can't remember right now or different worlds that are out there and then each of these levels the alimet will call them something else etc and this these are the areas in which the angels descend with the instructions of allah subhanahu ta'ala in the some of the mba that are parked in each level of the heaven and so on and so forth so these are the things that we know about simply from the hadith or from the quran there is no you know data or because this is something that's not observable with the human eye so the the uh the corsi and the arch the stool and the throne of allah wa ta'ala which are just creations are on top of all of that but the kursi is not where allah sits it's not like a throne or it's not like a chair like i'm sitting on because allah cannot be encompassed by place or space or time or circumstance but these are the one of the creations of allah just like allah created the food and just like allah created the pen so on and so forth uh but that's sort of a little bit of the cosmology and then there's seven there's seven lower realms we ask to protect us from the lower realms and to take us to the higher realms and show so when you have a hadith for example in which the prophet saw salaam says is a treasure from the treasures that are buried beneath the throne of god now you know why that's a big deal because then you understand where the throne of god sits on in comparison to all of the things that we just mentioned so when the prophet saseb says something like that that's your ticket that's your key the whole religion is based on la hallo your whole relationship with allah subhanahu wa is based on that and then based on what we just said you can also understand how great and how awesome was the maharaja of the prophet isaiah for him to be able to go through these different levels and then you can also understand why allah subhanahu ta'ala caused the chest of the prophet saws to be slit open and his heart to be washed etc because this in a way was physical preparation for that physical journey that no nobody no human body can sustain that type of journey i mean look they're trying to go to mars and start just you know uh just you know quote-unquote space that whole like spacex thing is like all like anticlimactic for me like they just go very high and then they come back and they call that space but whatever but look at how much money and how much preparation they need just to go up a few miles and then come back imagine the journey of the maharaja the prophet saws had to be prepared physically in a way that nobody else can and that's one of the hikmas of the episode of the of the of the chest of the prophet saws being slit open i mean there's other meanings to it we remind ourselves of it during the island inshaallah okay so that's about the heavens in the skies uh i believe you have mentioned in the past that home loans and auto loans do not involve ribba because they involve an underlying tangible asset that is correct what about student loans a college degree is certainly an asset in today's economy but would not be considered tangible so no when we talk about the loan having an asset it means like something physical because it's alone but the loan that you take for a student student loan it's to finance your education so there's a difference between financing something and taking a loan on something and based on that you say that it is permissible to have the student loan and then those like debt forgiveness programs and there are different types of loans they have different types of conditions it's not like taking a personal loan to go on a shopping spree i do not feel comfortable attending jummah given the continued risk of kovid because of the crowd in a tight space are men under an obligation to attend juma at this time well that's too specific of a question um of course abstractly if somebody feared going to the mosque then that fear if they felt if they feared harm to their personal body or their you know their well-being and the fear was genuine and justified like uh like let's say they're like we're in the city and they're like mass protests and like people throwing rocks and buildings and stuff like that and you you were scared to go to jummah be like yeah you can stay home and pray because you know there's fear but the problem is if i say oh if you're scared to go to jumma then everyone's going to wake up tomorrow and be like i'm scared to go to jeremiah not go to jummah and uh now we have the vaccines and we have a high level of vaccination at least in our area and we take precautions in the mosque and everyone has to wear a mask i mean i'm not wearing a mask because i'm teaching but other than that would be wearing a mask so because of those precautions it should be safe and disinfectant and this and that so i wouldn't say right now now that we're almost two years into it i would i wouldn't say that it's justified anymore but if you're a person and you have underlying conditions and you haven't been vaccinated for whatever reason let's park the reasons aside then uh yeah you could find a justification that you don't come to the masjid but but that would be very flimsy in my in my view given where we are now maybe a year ago yeah uh you know there were times where you know i didn't wouldn't want to come to the mosque in the very beginning but now i think we're we kind of know what we're dealing with we've taken precautions so on and so forth muslim high school students often want to attend social events at schools that are mixed gatherings example dances football games etc is it permissible for them to attend if so what principles conditions must they keep in mind so life is mixed you know it's not just this football game life is mixed anywhere you go it's we're mixed right here in the mosque so there's a way to do it and then there's a way to protect yourself and then there's a way not to do it and we all know what those rules are so you go with your friends and you you maintain your edib and you don't do anything that is haram then it's fine because that's part of the school experience um you know maybe the dances is something where i mean i know the school dances now are much different than when i was going to school uh so it's hard for me to give a you know blanket statement about that but other school activities my school itself is mixed why don't why do why don't you feel uncomfortable while going to school so that that that line of thinking is is flawed everything is mixed our job is to act appropriately life is mixed you're going to get out of school you're going to go to work and you're going to go to work and then you're gonna have to go on business trips and you're gonna have to go on outings and you're gonna have to go to happy hours and all that kind of stuff so you have to learn how to deal with that stuff from now don't don't say oh this is haram i just go to class and i come back and then you go to work and then you don't know what to do and you're overwhelmed because then you're going to flounder and make mistakes so what you need to do is you need to learn to maintain your islam to maintain your practice to maintain you know proper decorum especially with people of the opposite sex uh to be on the safe side most people because they don't have a tradition like this they get it this is where they get in trouble they send flirtatious emails or they they're flirting at work and then that's misconstrued as abuse or advances and uh people cry you know sexual abuse and this and that and we have a we have very s very straightforward rules about that not being alone with somebody of the opposite gender you know lowering your gaze which is not like just physically lowering your gaze but it's like you know calm down don't make advances don't touch people that don't need to be touched so on and so forth if you do that you're going to be safe not just in the football game or wherever but in life because if you practice that then you're going to be fine and you know going around hugging everyone is not professional i remember when i was when i was when i got my phd my advisor was a woman and there's a ceremony where they put the hood on your on your your gown and that's like supposed to be the sign that you got your phd uh and right before we went on stage she turned to me and she was like i don't know she's not muslim sorry i don't hug because that's not professional i only shake hands i said oh it's good for me i don't know i don't hug either right for other reasons and then that was very respectful uh and um so you know this is a good opportunity to practice those things is it halal to eat beer battered fish fried in oil offered at restaurants it would seem only trace amounts of alcohol would remain if any after the cooking process i'm sorry that's a no-go because alcohol is negative is richly impure so the beer makes the fish nedges even if the alcohol is evaporated so try again my husband smokes he doesn't realize how much i worry about him and his health i begged him many times to quit but he keeps going back to smoking i feel that if he hears it from you he might take it seriously and try harder to quit it bothers me so much and gives me nightmares i mean masha'allah you have so much stock in me i don't know if i have that much stock in myself but i will try so there are two or there are several issues number one is that there are differences between cigarettes and other forms of tobacco cigarettes for sure without doubt are nasty nasty stuff because it's not just tobacco it's tobacco mixed with other uh components that purposely cause addiction so that's why cigarettes are problematic and i don't know of anyone that says that cigarettes are not are are permissible the other types of tobacco there is a difference of opinion because it's tobacco is a natural product and uh it's not necessarily by itself addictive but at the end of the day it's not a good habit to start out with and most of the bodies they say that smoking in general is just as a blanket concept is not permissible but there is a difference of opinion as i said with the other stuff that's one thing the other thing is that it's an issue of addiction so if you're i'm assuming that it's cigarette smoking for whatever reason but it requires it doesn't require me requires a chemical approach to undo the addiction whether it's like the gum whether it's the patch or something like that and part of that is also just the habit the habit of taking the cigarette and lighting it so something you need something to you know maybe you need like a fidget spinner and you need like a test beer you need something because you have to replace all of these habits if you've been doing this forever then it's just a habit it's not just the chemical addiction but you need something to undo that habit so you have to look at it sort of with all of these things together to stop and inshaallah if you believe that you can stop you will stop by the will of allah please explain the etiquette of friday jummah is it okay to come just in time for the prayer they say that the two raka's is because the sermon is counted as two raka's if i miss the sermon should i pray well it depends how good the khutbah is no i'm just kidding so um there is great reward attached to coming to the mosque early on friday the prophet saw salam said you know the person that comes to the mosque the first hour of the day the second hour of the they each get huge amounts of reward i mean i know in this country it's difficult because we have work and other obligations but just just i'm just letting you know that rather than aiming for what's the cut off time for you know the latest i can make it to jomon we should also remember that there's great reward in going early you know reading some quran uh listening to somebody's reciting the quran so on and so forth that being said the fick of the matter is that the the the last possible opportunity to make it to drama prayer is that if you come before the raku of the second raka if you make it before the rokua of the second raqqa then you've made juma if you come after the rokua of the second raqqa you've missed jummah you've prayed in jamaica and when the imam does saddam salaam you have to stand and make up for raka's but if you come before the rakuwa of the second raqqa then you've made juma and the jamaa when the imam says said i'm salaam you only have to stand up and make up one raqqa now please don't take what i'm saying i don't want this friday to see everybody come at the end because this friday what i'm going to do is i'm going to triple the the time to make sure that people are going to oh i'm going to come late and then they're going to find me still talking so don't don't do don't aim to do that but just so you know it's like in your back pocket just in case you come late and stuff like that we've all come we've all come late before it happens but don't make it a habit because this is a this is a day that the prophet saw said is greater than the day of the day of friday and this there are many many hadith about the meritorious aspects of the day of friday and attending and seeing other people so if you liven up you know your jumaan insha allah you'll get more out of it all related is another friday question they say there is a time on fridays when special duas are accepted can you throw throws some lights there are certain things that allah has hidden from us on purpose allah has hidden from us in the last 10 odd nights allah has hidden the saint amongst his creation allah has hidden the hour on friday from all of the hours on friday allah has hidden our accepted actions throughout all of our actions why allah has hidden these things in order for us to seek them out so allah from us so from the beginning of ramadan to the end of the ramadan we try our best every day every night to make dua to worship allah so that we can guarantee that we get ramadan allah has hidden from us the hour that is accepted the dua on friday in order that we spend as much time on friday as we can to make dua allah has hidden the saint amongst all of us so that we respect everybody because we don't know who amongst us is the saint from who is not the same so allah hides certain things for those reasons so the answer is we don't know what the hour is so therefore we should try at least you know as much as we can on friday to ask allah subhanahu wa time why can't a woman say talaq three times and divorce and call it a day so somebody's upset so first of all first of all talaq is only one way of ending a marriage and talaq is a male initiated ending of a marriage a woman-initiated ending of the marriage is called an hula and a court-initiated ending of the marriage is infested so people don't understand that they just think talaq and that's it talaq is given to the man because the talaq is impacted by simply the verbal the vocalization of the instruction of talaq so if somebody if i said to my wife anti talib and i was joking it would count because it's serious so this is given to the man because usually not always but usually the man will be able to break himself from pronouncing it not not all the time there are many men that you know every time they get mad i divorce you a million times and get into trouble and things like that so because of that that's reserved for the man but then there's the hola that the woman can initiate a divorce through the court and she can divorce the husband and then return the maha to the husband so don't forget that you know they don't tell you this when they when they talk bad about islam they will give you one half of the story so if you want to call it a day and divorce your husband you can do the hola and you can divorce them what is the significance of the prayer recited at the grave after it is closed some people do it as a practice and others don't it's a sunnah it's called a talk and after the body is pre placed in the grave we ask allah subhana kala for his looks for his for us the uh and if if you guys bury me please do this for me is that you you you sit at me where the head is of the body and you coach the deceased that the angels are going to come and ask you these questions they're going to ask you who is your lord you say allah is my lord. what is your book the quran is my book who is your prophet muhammad saw my prophet what is your faith islam is my religion so that's what you do because these are the questions that will be asked and we ask allah to give us a firm a firm tongue and a firm response so this is a sunnah and because it's a sunnah it's something that we should do and it can be done in any language of course but it's called a talpin and we do that i think right when we bury people we've done that many times uh you know unless stuff will i forget or something like that but i if i'm pretty sure that every time i've gone uh i i make a point to do it you know i sit and pray uh i sit and pray and feel that it is not as rewarding as standing although i do have issues with my leg your take as long as somebody has a sharia excuse take comfort that allah has accepted everything of course i say this and i pray normally and if you know when i'm sick and i can't and i have to sit i also feel like crap too and i know that i'm saying this even though i feel the same way because that's the iman inside us we feel like i want to do more but rationally we have to remind ourselves that this is allah has allah is not in need of the exercise from us if we're fine with our limbs and our standing and our prostrating and our then we pray that way but if we can't then we pray however we can and we know with certainty that allah has accepted from us because the prayer it's the it's the it's the sincerity of your prayer that you're bringing to the prayer allah says when you slaughter an animal you're not feeding god he's not looking at the blood and measuring the meat it's your taqwa that you bring it's the act it's the sincerity of the act so focus on your sincerity focus on your presence and insha allah you will be rewarded and you will feel that same reward because you're not trying to circumvent the sharia you are following the sharia in doing that so therefore you will find that comfort insha allah okay there's like four more questions so if people have things they want to type or ask you can get ready is it wrong or a bidder for the imam to make dua aloud after the juma prayer is concluded and the people say i mean after each dua no because the sunnah is to have the not just drama but of all of the prayers the sunnah is that we recite uh subhanallah 33 uh alhamdulillah 33 allah 33 and then we make dua so whether you do it individually or you do it in congregation that's a sunnah so the idea that it's that's that's uh the the structure of that thinking is incorrect because aslan the the act in itself is a sunnah it's not like we made up this thing that's the sunnah how we end the prayer so why not do it together because if we do it together we don't know who amongst us is saying i mean and it will be answered just a few questions ago we talked about how the saint amongst us is hidden the dua is also hidden we don't know which dua will be maybe one of us will be saying i mean and all that dua will be answered so i would rather rely on the group than rely on myself because islam is a religion of the community so when the imam does the other benefit is that's how the kids are going to know what to say after the prayer because they're going to grow up hearing it it's going to be normal that's how i learned it because that's what i saw my father doing or we would go to the mosque in egypt in the summers a man would do that after the prayer so i learned it just by that no one taught it to me but i just learned it that that's part of the prayer so there are multiple benefits right it's just like uh when you say no um saw all the people praying taraweeh prayer by themselves and then he brought them together why don't you guys do it together and that's how we have the sunnah of this of the taraweeh so that's there's no buddha in it whatsoever how many times must one say that what is the minimum what is the maximum the you don't even have to say it as i said earlier that's just itself the the if you are going to engage in that sunnah which we all do then you say it three times if you have time to do it more then you try to do it an odd number of times our movies haram can you explain are movies haram can you explain in detail as to why they are or aren't that's like asking about music is music hallelujah so it's it depends what the movie is obviously uh because there are movies that will certainly be haram and there are movies that are not haram and then there's all the stuff in between so what what is good in the movie is is permissible what is bad in the movie is haram because there's a general concept watching tv or uh movies let's just you know put the extremes on either side off for a moment you know the stuff that we find in the normal our normal selection you take out of it what you bring to it there are people that will watch movies and they will understand that the theme of the movie that the storyline is a uh is that i think there's a bug right there is that it looks kind of big you don't have to kill it but i just look um there are people that will watch a movie for example and they will see in that storyline this like massive social commentary and it will get them to discuss things and it'll get them to talk about things so on and so forth and there are people that just watch a movie because they just want to kill time it's the same movie so try to be the former kind try to be the person that reads and understand reads into what they're watching and benefits from what they're watching but as a concept is it haram no it's not haram why because [Music] the issue is where people uh will have a problem or someone will say to me well how about watching uh a woman that's not covered on the screen or something like that the idea of lowering your gaze is an idea when he was with his companions in persia in those areas to the east his companions they came to him and they complained and they say we don't know how to lower our gaze because everywhere we look women are uncovered so imam jafar he said the haramness of looking at these women has been lifted for you why because it's what we say it's it's common if every woman like in our society the people that are covered are very few if you see a hijabi it's like one in like you know a thousand so therefore there's there's no you can't lower your gaze physically you can lower your gaze spiritually but you can't lower your games physically because there's no worry you're just gonna keep walking down like this all your life and bang into how can you drive like that or how can you go to work like that you can't so it's not practical so it's the same thing with the cinema it's the same thing with movies it's just that's that's what's normal now what's normal now is that people don't cover it's not necessarily a good thing but because of that there is a different approach and a different understanding to to lowering your gaze like the thing about the question about the football game and the high school activities and stuff like that lower your gaze as a spiritual practice keep your boundaries don't say something haram don't look with you know with lustful eyes don't flirt don't touch that's what matters because that's the stuff that's going to lead to to the haram but lower your gaze doesn't mean that you walk around like this all the time and then you bang your head in the wall because there's nowhere else to look so that's not going to work so the sharia is flexible that so our movie is haran in general i would say no as long as it doesn't take you away from your prayer as long as it doesn't you don't waste so much time on it so on and so forth same type of thing i would say about music the good of it is good and the haram of it is the bad of it is haram and this is how the prophet saws answers the question about poetry it's good it's good and it's bad is bad and then the second time the second look yeah but that's the second look is haram in a normal circumstance like when you go when you go to uh [Music] when you when i used to go to jeddah now i don't know now things have changed but when i used to go as a kid you know everybody is in the public all women have their faces are covered so if you're in a public space and all women their faces is covered and they're all wearing black but a woman walks in and her face is not covered you yourself you will lower your gates because you will feel like oh that's something that i shouldn't see naturally you would lower your gaze in that context yeah if i look if i if i lower my gaze but then i peaked again yeah that's the second look but now when everyone no one is covered you know uh it's not like what imam jaffra saddam said in investing in index funds index investing in the stock market is investing in a company and it's high it's permissible and the index fund is our funds as far as i understand that mimic uh different markets whether it's s p 500 or whether it's different you know different companies that are considered the largest most stable most profitable countries uh companies in the country so it's just like investing in the companies themselves um the questioner also asked about halal investing i mean i'm not an investment advisor but as long as you're not you know investing in a company that's making a haram product or like destroying the world then it's permissible to invest in the company to buy stocks and then you pay zakay on those shares and so on and so forth if you want actual advice on investing you have to go to somebody else that's more qualified but from the point of view of the sharia there's nothing impermissible about that anybody have any questions online you can type them in this is the end of the questions i have that were sent to me or the um want to go to homura and you have a visa no not yet but i mean i'm going to go with a group so what's the problem they open it up to everybody so like would they pander oh so you wanted to go all by yourself no i mean i can go [Music] are you vaccinated okay if you're vaccinated then you take your precautions when you go you know wear a mask and i mean maybe social distancing might not be part you can pick odd times to do the homura or the tawaf and the sai you can do toe off and then if it's too crowded go back to the hotel and go later to do say they don't have to be done back-to-back you know things like that but if you like in the middle of the night or in the middle of the day where like you know everyone's resting you can you know take your precautions of how to do it uh but you know who amongst us will have the opportunity to go and not go this is not like a year ago where i'd be like yeah maybe it's but because the authorities have allowed are allowing it that means that they have deemed it more or less safe and therefore we have to trust in that i mean the the hajj authority the saudi hajj authority if they deem it that safe you know they've been very conservative about the whole thing so if they deem it safe then i would trust that that's permission to go and you know if you can go i would go anybody else do you have anything no one passed you any questions forever no it could be that everyone in the chat just fell asleep but no there are no questions of course we get one question you can ignore this question of too controversial no we are awake okay you can ignore this question if it's too controversial but could you comment on the issue of tawassum and esteretha it's not controversial because uh tawasu is a form of making dua to allah subhanahu ta'ala by mentioning something that is precious to allah subhanallah tyler so asking allah subhanahu ta'ala by uh you know this act that you did you know that was solely for the sake of allah subhanahu ta'ala for asking allah subhanahu ta'ala by mentioning uh his all of his attributes or asking allah subhanahu ta'ala by mentioning the prophet's name but who are you asking what are you asking allah to allah like the story of the the prophet saws the people from the time of ben islam there were three dudes that were stuck in a cave a big rock kind of came and each one made dua to allah and made tawasul and they each mentioned an act that they did that was purely for the sake of allah and each person when they made dua the stone moved a little bit the second guy may die the stone moved a little bit more the third guy made dua that way and then the stone movement they were able to to go so this is what means it means to ask allah by mentioning something close to allah in the in the modern muslim discourse when we when we talk about usually what people are referring to is to ask allah by mentioning the prophet's name but the reason i introduced it this way so you understand that it's a much larger concept and uh if you understand that with whatever i mentioned is asking allah subhanahu wa ta'ala then you understand that this is a form of asking allah and all of the muslim of the history of islam in its entirety all said that that was permissible except one person he been tamiya and eben tamir as i've mentioned before was thrown into jail by the olympia because he made those kind of mistakes so do you want to follow the one guy who went to jail because he made these mistakes or are you going to follow a thousand and four hundred years of scholarship that's what you have to ask yourself because that's that no one ever talked about this issue ever until even tamiya came and had a problem who was martyred several years ago in damascus he said one time i was in a conference in europe and uh never really spoke another he had like a working knowledge or a friendship like he never really could speak french that's what he says and he said i was in the uh conference and like this french like ultra secular lady got up and she just started spewing all of this hatred about islam and i got so mad and i asked allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and i made tawas by abdul qaddafi give me the ability to stand up and defend your dean and he said i i didn't finish making this dua except that i unbeknownst to me i stood up and i started speaking in fluent french and i responded to the lady so this idea of tawas was this idea of it's a form of asking allah by what is precious to allah okay it's not controversial or anything i have an old copy of the quran the pages crumble on what do i handle respectfully uh if there's a if there's a if there are people that collect the old mossack if you can give it to them or if you can't you can burn burn them would be probably the best way and then you can bury the ashes or something like that if it's not usable i'm saying i'm better oh i think somebody's saying something private it's not about me i don't want to toss it out but need direction what i can do if it's about the most hot then you can you can burn it and then bury the ashes if you join the jamaa prayer at fajr do you miss praying the sunnah prior to fajr is it okay to pray that after the akama if you join the jamaa prayer you missed the sunnah prior is it okay to pray the two sunnah after the no pray this pray the fajr and there is an opinion that says you can pray those two raka's after the fajr prayer so uh don't like if you walk into the mosque on and for fajr prayer and they're standing to pray uh fajr if they're standing to pray join the prayer if you can like bust out two raka's really fast and it's not going to like make a commercial you could do that i guess but i mean just pray with everybody and then you can follow the opinion you can pray the two sunnahs afterwards inshallah okay we just ask allah to make us wake up for fajr every day i would be happy with that and he was so specific anyway how often i want to ask this person how often this happened to them come on guys yeah but there's an opinion that you can uh you can pray there's two raka's after fetching in that situation there's a line of credit on a home haram meaning you're taking out uh what does that mean can somebody explain it to me if it's a mortgage then we said the mortgage is permissible but it's the way it's phrases is if it's something in addition to the mortgage [Music] so it's a mortgage on top of the mortgage and you have the mortgage at the same time okay it's a second mortgage but not on an installment basis on a revolving so you can lose it without a fixed amount accessing your equity okay you said the mortgage just wait one second because you're new and you're going to take us back five years in the message just let me let me i'm coming to you right let me get back on the on the line of credit because i want to think about that so you take you already have your mortgage and then you take uh based on whatever equity you have on the house i see no the house is paid off in that case it's fine because and that's why i was asking because in this case the house is paid off if the house is paid off and you're taking out you have the asset between you and the loan then it's fine but the the home line on top of the mortgage that's what i would want to think about but the way this question is that should be okay yeah the bank interest is not ribba i know that's a news flash because you're new to the mosque yes but it's not riba uh bank interest is not about that does not mean that you cannot create a ribbony transaction in the bank you can if you take a personal loan for example because you want to go to las vegas in the weekend with your friends that would be absolutely haram because you have no way of paying that loan back but if you take if you finance your house if you buy the loan on the house or if you buy a car if you buy appliances or if you buy furniture or whatever those fi those financial transactions are hardened just to clarify on the line of credit condition of line of credit is you take money based on your income default the asset is taken away by the bank so in other words yeah between the money between the line of credit yeah i think that's what was going to explain to me that if that you're not going to take a loan against the whole house it's only your equity of which what you've paid off so far okay so then that should be then that should be permissive okay online do you guys have anything else what's the difference between what oh torso and yeah is to repeat something over and over again or like to read the quran is a way of making dua i ask you by all of your divine traits allah please forgive us that's tawasu is to ask allah by mentioning something that is close to allah it's a form of duality yeah that's that's how that's how it's usually you know that's you're mentioning something allah's name or you're reading the quran or something like that that's fine so this is not rebirth can you tell me how it's not when the prophet sasan came to define the financial transactions he said that the gold has to be traded with gold equal amounts silver has to be traded with silver equal amounts grapes have to be traded with grapes equal amount dates have to be traded with dates equal amounts i can't give you one gram of gold and say i'll lend you this gram of gold but next month you have to pray pay me 1.5 grams of gold that's riba now the question is in the time of the uh the time of the revelation the currency was the roman drachma the dirham the dinar and the dirham which were roman not islamic they became islamicized but they were the coins that were used by the roman empire the coins that were in the pocket of the prophet saws and the sahaba were roman christian coins that had the cross on them that's the currency that they used they didn't have paper money with the advent of time paper money is introduced at some point in time so then the question that the fukaha asks is paper money the same as gold and silver exactly or not imam shafi he said that paper money if it's not connected to gold and silver there is no ribba and paper money because allah has intended only there to be ribba in gold and silver there's something special that we don't understand rationally that makes gold and silver unique in its properties as currency as uh as uh metals that alone has paper money but that alone has ribba but if there's paper money that is not connected to the golden silver that paper money in it of itself does not have any ripple so that's one issue that's one thing one part of the answer the other part of the answer is that in the things that we're talking about the sharia doesn't the the modern forehead do not see these uh financial instruments as loans they see them as a means of financing something financing a car financing a home financing a project financing this or that so they make a distinction between a loan like a personal loan and finance so as long as it's a finance instrument which these things are and as long as there's an asset in between you and that financial structure like the house for example this case then those those transactions are permissible because the bank is not an individual person like i can't lend you out uh money between me and you based on what i just said i'm like oh it's paper money it's not gold and silver and you can pay me back that would be haram but the bank is a financial institution that is licensed to do this it's a theoretical person it's been licensed to do this it's a completely new structure it didn't exist at the time of the sahaba so therefore we have to understand it for what it is and then draw our rulings on it based on what we know from our source text so because of that we say that there is no reba and paper money as a concept in the sharia because as long as the paper money is not connected to the gold and silver so there's no gold back dollar anymore that that stopped in the 1970s and as long as the financial uh tool is used to finance an object or an item or a project then that finance that tool is permissible not now [Music] the money now is just supply and demand based on supply and demand they have gold reserves that's something else but it's not they're not linked it's not backed by gold i think it was the 70s nixon [Music] and then they internationally decoupled from the gold standard that was following world war two and then this is the first one and then in 1973 there was a second part in which they decoupled by the 70s [Music] [Music] that's the idea that's other thing i forgot to say is that interest in the bank that's return on the money that the banks invest your money is not in the bank your money is investing somewhere somehow it's not like there's a cubby with your name on it and the cash that you put in the atm is there waiting for you no it's we know that i think it's like a very small like 10 i don't know what the percentage is but it's only a small amount percentage if we all went to the bank that that would create you know that's that's how a depression would happen just because there would be no not enough cash where is that money but being invested it's being invested in these massive whatever infrastructure projects or whatever it is doing so when the bank if you have an interest bearing checking account for example that interest that comes back to you but that's the return on your investment your money is being invested so you want to buy stock in the bank bank that's another form of investing in the bank but simply by putting your money in the bank it is being invested in the bank yeah there is one issue which is in the lineup there is something the what the underlying asset okay essentially yeah i mean that's a very important difference it's when it gives you money against now but what you're trying to describe is in some ways which is yeah i said many times the personal loan without uh without an underlying asset that's haram it's another type of riva but it's but it's for another re not because of the the interest it's something else then probably the analysis you're saying i'm working with you but if you buy a second house best and you go work from the bank you'll get to buy a second house for investment purposes so that's the state so hello equity bonds that that's uh also another form of investment like bonds like cities that issue bonds or companies that issue bonds it's a form of investment which is nothing wrong with that [Laughter] is that part of um community um her husband does not want him to get like the clover back scene because he's worried that it might make her like sick in the future so she's really been struggling with this it's okay if she gets it like she doesn't need like kids i i don't know like a specific will or something there's no rational or islamic or otherwise for not taking the vaccine so people that don't want to take the vaccine that's a personal choice i mean i'm not gonna say it's haram or you have to but there's no there's no uh it's just like hocus pocus belief i mean so that's not going to work the way we got out of you know all of these other problems you know polio and the measles and this this and that is because we had vaccines and we had medicine and penicillin and all that kind of stuff so there's no you know there's no basis for people that are against the vaccine yes there are things that are unknown about it and but we have the over arching effort global effort to produce this vaccine should give us a level of comfort that it's safe it's safe for us to use safe enough for us to use so i mean i personally think that we all need to be vaccinated because it's a pandemic it's in the pandemic when you need to be vaccinated outside of the pandemic i could i could see why people would be hesitant or if we live in an area that doesn't have a certain disease why do we have to be vaccinated against it i respect that but it is in times of the pandemic where we have to think beyond ourselves and think of the community and not just the community not just our community but you know everybody um that's why you know people that forge vaccine documents that's haram you know people that forge these things to circumvent but they can live their life that's you know that's impermissible so i would strongly advocate for everybody in our community to become vaccinated because that's safe and that's what we need to do for the you know it to get out of this situation and if uh you know if if a husband is telling his wife you know forbidding her to get the vaccine i would argue that that's one of the circumstances where she would not have to obey her husband just like when hin came to the prophet saw sallam to complain about abu sufyan and said that abu sufyan is a stingy man can i take from him uh to support myself and the children and the prophet saws take only what you need so he didn't say take all of his money and go you know build a house somewhere just take what you need because that's your right so you know this is one of those circumstances to us in the name of someone other than the prophet's example imam jilani how would one do that can you give an example i thought we don't need an intermeric intermediary there's no intermediary between what you but you are mentioning something that is close to allah to augment your ask so rather than relying just on me asking ya allah i ask you by you know the knowledge of imam shepherd you know helped me er in this endeavor so you're asking allah you're not asking somebody you're not asking your membership is dead you're not asking me but you're mentioning something that you know is close and mighty and great okay this is gotta be the last quote okay is it correct that during the time of the prophet saws he forbade the writing of the hadith no the prophet saws directly asked certain sahabah to write down the hadith and that's why there were different compilations of the hadith at the time of the prophet saw sallam those written compilations in addition to the hadith that were memorized are the things that god added that got formed into the hadith canon several centuries later so that's not correct both the quran and the hadith were written during the time of the prophet sallallahu alaihi in addition to them being or memorized and orally narrated a lot of investings i own stocks i'm not an investment advisor by the way so don't ask me what to do i own stocks in an investing with retirement in mind to be clear i believe i owe zakay on the profits second i also have iras i don't think i owe zakat on these retirement funds so you read my article about thoughts on zakah on my website making sense of islam i talk about the this issue of the retirement funds uh the differentiation what is odzek on and what is not ozake on uh if you own straight out uh stocks yes you're gonna pay zakat on those in the retirement fund you're not gonna pay zakay on the retirement fund for the reasons that i argue in the um article is that it violate or it does not fulfill one of the most essential conditions of paying zakat which is complete ownership and mirkut the retirement account it's in your name it's for your benefit but you actually don't 100 own it in the definition of the sharia because if you take a withdrawal now you're going to end up paying taxes so i articulate all of that and i talk about what happens after the age of retirement so for those details please read the article it will be much more fresh than what i will present right now aloha vaccine as one instance where the wife can tear the husband [Laughter] foreign you
