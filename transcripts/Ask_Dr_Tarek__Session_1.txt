so i have some questions that were sent i'm going to go over the questions i have them here i'll go over them one by one inshallah uh some of them will be short there's a couple of repeats uh one or two need a little bit of explanation and at this as always i will open the chat and if anybody wants to ask anything for clarification or other questions that are not on the list that's fine and so that will be the format insha allah for this evening so i'll begin the first question is a summary of an ongoing open question in my mind is as follows it is about balancing dean and dunya cognitively and spiritually dare one be aspirational i would like to be unequivocally clear for myself but also to inform and educate my family and community it's not about scheduling time although i could certainly improve there as well dunya is an interlude but doesn't allah want us to do our best in this world as well whether as a doctor engineer broker teacher mother in business etc so we are better able to live and lead a civil society better able to help humanity but if eternal life is our focus how do i best balance with my desire to leave behind an honorable legacy if he wills and seek protection health and happiness for my children community and humanity is the balance about seeking a decent life making a difference but avoiding distraction in its pursuit i'd appreciate your thoughts if there is time before i answer that question i should also say that these are anonymous so the questions that i have here i don't know who's asked them so i'm just reading them so somebody is embarrassed that i've read their question i don't don't be embarrassed i'm just reading them so people can benefit so basically this question is about you know dunya and dean and a lot of people especially people in the west and especially people that are materially successful that are religiously minded they have this confusion that they feel that there is a competition or that there is somehow tension between the two so there are two hadith that will help clear this issue the first hadith is the hadith of anas is narrated in the collection of imam in which the prophet sallallahu alaihi said if in your hand is a seed and the trumpet of the final hour will be blown and you see that it's going to be blown plant that seed that hadith is the ultimate answer of how the disposition of the believer is that we have one eye on the world and one eye on the hereafter because this world we must live in it in order to arrive at the hereafter so in that hadith the prophet salallahu is saying you have to give the dunya everything that you have you have to build you have to grow you have to advance not just for you and for your family but for the community no matter what even if the hour is about to you know is right there even if it's all going to be over but we will be judged on our actions allah will take us and what did you do with the life that i gave you with the wealth that i gave you the time that i gave you so we want to be able to answer insha allah we used everything that you gave us to the best of our ability for the betterment of our community and this is related to another hadith that is that is the hadith of that's narrated in sahih muslim in which the prophet saws he said the strong believer is better and more beloved to allah subhana kara than the weak believer even though there is good in both so the strong believer is the believer who is strong financially is strong mentally is strong emotionally is strong physically why are they more beloved to allah because they can help other people the strong believer can be in assistance to somebody else so there's no contradiction the sahaba were completely connected to their obedience completely and connected to their spiritual devotion at the same time they conquered vast lands and they built an empire and they built a legacy that carried forth the prophetic message of the prophet so there's no contradiction between the two because the contradiction is something that exists in the christian faith in which there is this tension between god and caesar and should i be like a a little monastic life or we don't have that in our faith tradition we don't have that conflict at all uh imam manic radiology the famous um imam of of medina the the the the one whose the med of manic is named after you know he was extremely wealthy and very well dressed and he had beautiful horses and you know but he was this great uh jurist so we have no contradiction between the two as long as the dunya does not occupy our heart so this is not a justification for us to sacrifice our you know devotional work and our obedience to allah for the dunya but when we engage in the dunya and we do so with the right intention we are going to be rewarded for all of that engagement because all actions are based on intentions in so these two hadith should help you know paint a different picture for you that there is no contradiction between the two that we should be aggressive in pursuing a worldly life with the intention of bettering ourselves and bettering our community we must be a community of strength if we are to survive we must be a community of means if we are to survive or else will be forgotten with time as other minority communities and other places have been forgotten so there's nothing wrong with that nor is there any contradiction in that someone asked do you have to pay zakah on your 401k funds that have not been withdrawn so there is no zakah on your 401k and i wrote an article not too long ago summarizing this position i will put the link it's a very short article i put the link in the chat uh the first the the article talks about three things related to zacchaeus the first thing is the the american 401 k so the main issue that you have to understand is that one of the main conditions for zakat to be obligatory is that you have complete possession what the sharia calls and complete possession and i go like this with my hand because it means if i hold something like this like i hold this piece of paper this is mine i can do with it as i want the issue with the 401 k is before the age of retirement it does not fulfill the sharia requirements of complete ownership because it is shielded by the the structure that is set up by the laws to preserve that money for retirement what is the proof of that is that if you take out a withdrawal before retirement you will pay a penalty that penalty from the perspective of the sharia means that you do not have complete ownership as is defined in the sharia so up until the age of retirement there is no zakah on the 401k at all after the age of retirement you're going to pay 10 percent on the return of the fund it's outlined in the article so i recommend that you read the article first and then if there's a follow-up question we can deal with that can we get life insurance personally or receive it as part of a company offering yes because the modern focal hat understand that modern life insurance to be a fine a new financial structure that is to protect people in society and therefore they allow it should a wife keep her family last name or take her husband's from the islamic view the preferable uh option is that she keeps her name because we do not swap names in our tradition again this is not something that is from our tradition uh and it's important that we keep lineage and we keep names and that's something that's very important now if some people have done it for whatever reason and you know they've been filing taxes like that and all of their you know their driver's license and all their paperwork like that that's fine you don't necessarily have to undo it's not necessarily haram because it wasn't done for a haram reason but as a practice it's something that we should avoid because it's not something that's from our tradition it's just we don't have that culture every person is an individual person and their name is their name so that would be preferable not to do that and these like hyphenated names and you know that's not our way either you know uh the neseb the lineage in this world is established through the father and the lineage and the hereafter is established through the mother that's why when we do the talking of the of the deceased we call them by their mother's name you know so this is not like a patriarchal thing or a male dominated thing this is you know stuff that comes down from the from the sharia so it's best that everyone keeps keeps their name someone asks did all the prayers get introduced at the same time yes and that is from the many hadith that talk about the israel in the maharaja when the prophet saw them ascended and discoursed with allah and he was given the 50 prayers and then they were reduced as we know in the well-known story until they became five prayers and they get the reward of the 50. so it was a one one-stop you know piece of legislation that gave us the five prayers a follow-up question that to that could be or should be was there prayer in islam before the five obligatory prayers and the answer is yes there was prayer in islam before the five obligatory prayers and there is a hadith that is narrated you can find it in the collection of even allah's encyclopedia of the sahaba there's a sahaba by the name of afif who narrates a story that he came to an abbess in the jahilya in mecca to trade with him and when he was there he noticed a man who was the prophet sallallahu sallam come out of like a home and with him was a woman who was say the khadijah and was with him a young man who was said nani and they washed in a funny way and they made these prayer movements so this hadith of hafif is ner and he said when i asked him what is this he said oh this is my nephew he claims that he's a prophet and you know this is his religion and our thief says in the hadith i wished that i would have become muslim at that moment and i would have been the first to become muslim so this hadith is used by the lament to prove that this hadith was it's so early that sadness who still had not become muslim that the only muslims were the prophet isaiah his wife say the khadijah and imam ali who was a young boy in their house and the prayer in the beginning was two raka's two raka's two raka's and then that was replaced by the five daily prayers and the reason i say this is that the prophet salallahu says there is no good in a religion or a faith that has no prayer so prayer is a quint essential part of faith and religion there has to be something that you do a devotional obligatory act of worship to acknowledge the things that you believe in so prayer and therefore it's corollary which is washing for prayer was always existing from the from the initial revelation even before satan abu bakr became muslim why don't we say prayers out loud because that's how it was legislated and there are many things in the sharia that do not have a rational explanation why don't we eat pork uh you know people try to rationalize that and they'll say um because it's dirty and filled yeah but there are other things that that can be considered filthy that we eat once we wash them so ultimately there are certain things that there are no rational explanations for and that's why it is a religion it is a faith because we believe in the unseen and we believe and submit to it so when we have something like this we call it we do it out of worship why do we pray and ask for raka's quietly and why is fajr out loud two raka's because that that's how it was taught to us by the prophet so we don't enter into religion just with our reason but we enter with belief and submission so it's a good question because it reminds us of that important truth now that doesn't mean that there aren't rational explanations but there are and i'm sure somewhere somebody in islamic history has sought to rationally make sense of that but it's not a complete answer because the complete answer is that that's how the prophet saws taught us and therefore we follow should we pay zakah on college savings account no because my understanding of it which i i want to verify but my understanding is that it's shielded in the same way that the 401k is that means is if you put money into the i think they're called 529 or something like that if you put money into that and then you withdraw it later for a non-educational reason you're penalized that penalty therefore tells me that you've it's left your ownership and now it is deposited in the special fund that is invested and protected by the government for the purposes of education so i would say no is life insurance permissible we answer that insha allah it's permissible for a widow while in her edda period why is it forbidden for her to travel like the the assad question because that is how allah has legislated it it comes from the quran and it is something that has an immense amount of reward for the woman so rather than and this is where sometimes our culture needs to catch up with our faith rather than thinking that it's a period of restriction uh and immobility it should be thought of as a period of purity and great reward and closeness to allah it is so important that even things like the hajj won't be performed so something as large as the hajj for that to be not performed because of the edda tells us the immense importance that allah has placed on the edda for the woman so and and that's why i said it's a it's a cultural shift that needs to happen because culturally some people see it as i'm stuck or i can't do this or i can't do that and they don't see the spiritual and religious opportunity uh in it so it's something that is a great great i mean it's something that women have that men don't have it's a great opportunity for women of corba of obedience of reward you know multiple rewards during that period and it's something that should be seen as such now related to that is that there's a common misconception that women are not allowed to leave the house and in some cultures unfortunately that's what people think but that's not the case that simply means that the woman remains spends the night every night during that day period in the marital home it doesn't mean that during the day she can't go out if she has to and you know if she's working or things like that or if she has to go see a doctor or you know appointments like that so that's another culture again that sometimes our culture is is behind our religion not not ahead of it what are the requirements for an islamic wedding well there is the nikah there's the marriage and then there is the celebration of the marriage for the marriage there are the witnesses there is the mahara of course there's the bride in the groom and there is the exchange of the agreement of marriage which in islamic law is a contract so it falls under contract law which means that the phrases that are exchanged between the two need to match one another and that's you know recorded in the books of the film and usually there's like an imam there that you know say repeat after me and that's it and that's done you know with the two weaknesses and that that means that it's public it's something that is known it's a very simple thing you know we've done the nikah in the mosque now i don't know dozens of times uh it it's something that literally takes less than half an hour the nikah itself the marriage itself to to bring two people together in marriage it takes less than half an hour as far as the lima which is the celebration of that is that you invite people you sacrifice an animal you invite people to a hall or your home or wherever there's a you know you can to celebrate the union of this of these two people because this is something that is from the sunnah of allah that he created us as pairs that we find each other that we build families this is the sunnah of the prophet and in this day and age it's something that we should really celebrate because you know marriage is something that's so elusive for so many people so therefore when we find it we have it and inshallah we encourage it amongst our children we should and our community we should celebrate it that's it very simple everything in islam is super simple you know you don't have to do more than what i what i stated and my my personal wish is that we would all together change our cultural ways that have overburdened the marriage process and you've heard me speak about this before and i don't want to criticize any ethnic community by name all all of our ethnic you know muslim majority ethnic communities i think have over abused the marriage uh you know process have created all of these hurdles and obstacles that sometimes are almost impossible uh to overcome so it's you know it's not it's not good because it prevents us from you know having an easy marriage i'm not saying we shouldn't be happy and celebrate you know there's nothing wrong with partying and having a good time in a high-level way but when we overdo it and the threshold of marriage you know with all of the things that are the all the money that is being spent it's just not a good sign that that's a union that's going to last and i speak from experience and this is stuff that we've seen okay next question i have been pondering about this when i was little growing up it was a thing that we used to do sometimes we memorized words of the quran in the bathroom while bathing or showering and on the eight day when we would have a bath we would recite i think it's a taketh or something like that now i hear it should not be done how come we take ablution repeating words from the quran namely please clarify now remember that when we have hadiths that talk about wudu there's no uh there's no bathroom at the time of the of the revelation the way we have bathrooms in other words people would just take a cup of water you know go to the side and make their wadu so the questioner that's asking this question has to keep in mind that this is a modern problem a modern problem is now we have a modern a bathroom in which there's a sink and a toilet and a shower let's say if it's like a standard american or western bathroom this is a problem of the modern world it's not that there's a contradiction in in the quran and the sunnah because yes it's sunnah to say these things in the bathroom now the question is if i go into my modern bathroom and i'm making wudu can i say bismillah again the answer is yes because the prohibition of saying these things that we find in the hadith literature is about saying these things while you are relieving yourself as we would say in english while you are using the bathroom which is a polite way of urinating or the other thing so it doesn't mean going into the bathroom why because the bathrooms that we have now are clean they're not like an outhouse whereas in the time of the prophet salaam when you have to go relieve yourself you have to go far away you know dig a hole and do your thing while you're doing that you're not going to be recited quran and then later as that entered into the home you know maybe it was like a little room in which you were only doing that but our modern bathrooms now you know if if kisra and caesar saw our bathroom now they you know this is more fancy than the palaces that they had so the bathrooms that we have today are not what is referred to in the books of fick or in the the classical period because of the because of the you know new structure and things like that so to summarize if you go into let's look at our mosque because i'm sure all of you have seen the bathrooms in the masjid if you walk into that bathroom to make will do there's nothing wrong with saying bismillah if you walked into your shower at home and before you made a hustle or something on friday or a day and you recited you know bismillah nothing wrong with that there's no prohibition the prohibition is saying these while you are in the act of relieving yourselves because of the hadith against it i'm going gonna go there's a couple more and then i'll go to the ones on the chat just so i don't lose my flow is it emphasized in the quran that one should drink hold a cup with the right hand eat with the right hand place your right leg as the first step when leaving the work etc uh also the quran should be held in your right hand not the left what if you are left-handed it's natural the left hand is prominent to you as the foreign mentioned one is better than the other so again another uh like common uh issue that that muslims talk about the right hand the left hand yeah there are hadith about you know entering a passageway or a house or a door with the right foot exiting with the left and then reversing that when you go into the bathroom there are hadith to talk about that uh and it's a sunnah it doesn't mean that it's obligatory it doesn't mean like if i'm walking out of the mosque and you see somebody walking out with the right foot that you know they've committed like or something like that i mean that's not the case it's a sunnah but there are people that get super excited about that and the question is why are you even looking at what foot i'm walking look at yourself you know what foot did you walk out with you know look at yourself first so these are sunnas we don't belittle them but we belittle the people that take them out of context maybe i shouldn't say that but you know what i'm trying to say the idea is yes we have traditions of however when it comes to food again it is a sunnah to eat with your right hand uh if somebody were left-handed uh you know that's something that they would try to overcome because of the sunnah however when you are using both hands to eat there is no right left distinction and that's the key that most people forget what does that mean there are a hadith in which the prophet saws held two things with his hands and he was eating out of one and then eating out of another so when i apply that to the modern world if i sat at a western table with a western place setting how is the place setting the fork is on the left and then the knife is on the right you cut with the knife you're using your right hand and you eat with your left you are using both hands that's not haram because that is in compliance with the hadith that's narrated in ahmed but the prophet saws used to use both hands so if you are using both hands if both hands are being engaged at the time of eating then you eat with both so if you ever get invited to the white house for a state dinner or buckingham palace or you know you don't have to freak out the forks on the left and the knife all you have to do is make sure you don't drink the champagne and the wine because that's haram but you know cutting like this and then eating there's nothing wrong with that just like if you were at a fast food place and you had a soda in one hand and you're you're taking a bite out of a burger and drinking or something like that there's nothing wrong with that uh as far as uh holding the quran with the right and the left i've never seen that so it depends you know sometimes your wrist gets tired and you switch there's nothing wrong with that um there's no prohibition against doing that uh sometimes you hold it in your left because you're writing or sometimes you're switching or you know there's nothing wrong with that the idea is with the right left hand is when you are grabbing going to grab something to eat the sun that is that you do it with your right hand okay the next question is a 401k question again the 401k question we covered so you have to read the quest you have to read the article that i wrote to understand before the age of retirement which is currently 59 i think what i say in the article i consulted with somebody before i wrote it the current age yeah 59.5 before that there is no zakah after that 10 on the return read the article for the details it's only it's not that long this is a couple paragraphs and then if there are questions over that then we can talk about it and then the last question that was pre-sent if a person passes away and the families overseas what is that advisability to delaying the funeral and transporting the genes overseas what advice should we give the family who are conflicted with this issue we say in the sharia that the honoring of the deceased is bearing them so as soon as possible the the body should be washed shrouded preyed upon and buried [Music] in the islamic culture if we would say that the idea of delaying all of that for people to arrive doesn't necessarily exist that's a modern day thing and that's really done for the family of the deceased but our object is to honor the deceased what is how do you honor the deceased you honor them by taking care of their final rights as quickly as possible so as a blanket statement that would be my advice my advice is you know do it as quick as possible because that's what matters but you know let's say i went on like a trip or like a business trip to brazil and i died there okay now there's a problem because i'm not brazilian i don't have brazilian family and you know i'm traveling on a certain passport so in those circumstances the body would have to be sent back i'm assuming that you know the consulate or the embassy would have to be contacted those things are fine because of the laws and and the parameters in other words we're not delaying the barrier and the washing and all of that for other you know for a not important reason but if if somebody lives in another country and you live in another country and that person dies you know don't ask them to wait for you to go you know book your ticket and go as soon as possible and when you get there you'll receive the condolences of people you'll go to the grave you'll recite the feta had everything that's that's fine so that would be my my advice uh again it depends what the circumstance are sometimes you have to uh wait i mean we had a relative on my on my wife's side who he was traveling for vacation in europe and he died so he had his body had to be sent back because you know he couldn't be buried there that's okay the shadia allows for that but all things being the same the optimal way is to wash shroud and bury the body to pray janez and bury the body as soon as possible because this is how we honor the person that has died okay a couple of questions that came those are those are the questions that i had so i'm going to turn now to the chat uh if people want to add stuff or questions feel free uh to be married through nikah if the bridegroom is non-muslim would they need to convert yes one of the conditions of the marriage is that the you know the religion of the bride and groom be the same uh uh absolutely for the woman uh so if the woman is muslim the bride the groom has to be muslim that's you know by consensus and abu hanifa allows a dispensation the other way around if it is a muslim man you could marry somebody from the people of the book that's a position that i do not subscribe to so i do not conduct uh interfaith uh marriages uh for filthy reasons not not not because i'm you know antiquated or barbaric but for actual filthy reasons uh but yes in general there has to be the matching of the religion and almost every religion that i know of in its orthodox expression has the same condition so orthodox christians or orthodox jews or they would they would say the same thing i know many rabbis in this area that i work with uh and i've actually seen them share on their social media platforms articles expressing why you know a true jewish marriage can only happen when both the bride or groom are jewish and the arguments minus like the torah discussion the argument philosophically is almost the same as our argument but that is something that is important why because marriage is something that is divinely legislated it's not it's not like you go to the store to buy something it's something that comes from from revelation of the quran and the sunnah it is something that is determined by allah and our our obligation to comply to it it's not about being difficult or like not modern or something something like that does the officiant have to be an imam no no no it doesn't just has to be uh it can be a deputy of the state it could be something that has a marriage license it doesn't have to be the imam of the mosque at all what is the purpose of the mahar the maha is a gift from the husband to the wife for the wife to use as she wants it is something that is again comes from the revelation itself there are stipulations to how it is how it is determined uh so that it is a fair price for a a girl uh similar to the one being married meaning her sisters her cousins her relatives her neighbors and it is a um you know ultimately uh a gift uh that that the man you know expresses his uh his seriousness in engaging in the marriage by offering this to the woman of course it could be low there's no extent to how high it is or how low it can be but you know that's sort of where it comes from can a woman directly consent to her marriage or does it have to be done via well you know the woman has to consent you can't can't force somebody to get to get married that has to be consent uh that's the modern fil and i know in the classical fick there's a dispensation or a concept of marrying young girls minors we no longer allow that we no longer allow that universally in all muslim majority countries i mean whether it's enforced or not is another issue but i mean officially we don't why because physiology has changed because uh you know a 15 year old two three hundred years ago not like a 15 year old now uh so the sharia keeps up with that with that sort of stuff so we don't allow that anymore so you can't you can't just force somebody you can't just wake up oh here's your husband or here's your wife doesn't work like that there has to be consent if there's no consent then there's not going to be any harmony in the marriage of course so no you have to it doesn't the weli is just there to protect the woman's rights uh and to to signify that these are two families that are also joining in union but ultimately the woman has to consent or she has the right to reject let's say a woman comes um her father's like i got this guy for you to marry i want you to marry him and she can't you know in her mind no way you can't force her to do that you can't force her to get married it doesn't work like that can a a woman officiate a marriage no uh the officiation of their marriage is um can a woman officiate well you see there's no officiation the witnesses have to be men in the marriage that i know but it's really the bride and groom exchanging the agreement i want to think about that we don't have this concept of that's a good question i want to come and come back i have to think about that one can i explain the fifth position why muslim men cannot marry women from the people of the book well like i said there's a difference of opinion but basically what i'm saying which is not me but what imam is saying is that the people of the book now are not the people of the book at the time of the prophet saw the people at the time of the prophet i saw salam choose my words delicately so i don't i don't come across as saying something offensive they the christians and the jews at the time of the prophet isalam could trace their lineage more or less back to the original jewish and christian communities so if i found a jewish woman who was a real cohen a real descendant of harun alaihi salem that ma'am and shaffer will be like oh she is from the people of the book but now because of the name change and all and this was imam ishaq i was arguing this in the third century so this is like not like a new argument he said that's no longer valid because these are not the same people that was assumed at the time of the advent of the prophet so therefore it it reverts to its default which is that both people getting married have to be of the same faith community um that's the argument that's the argument behind the the shafi uh position now of course there's a dispensation so if like when i see a couple that's married a man that's a muslim man and he's not he's married to like you know a woman that's christian or something i mean i don't i don't make a fuss about it because i know that there's another opinion but i think it's important that people understand that this is a common misconception that muslims have that a muslim man can marry whomever he wants but a muslim woman can't at least with me it's the same you both can't you has to be a muslim and there's a lot of wisdom behind that a lot of wisdom the preservation of the faith and the raising of the children you know and and things like that okay so my homework is the woman officiating the marriage uh what else do i what else do you guys have for me um i'm gonna unmute folks in case they have a question so i'm gonna unmute them in a second so please uh if you want to ask a question directly you can you can talk um all right uh folks on the phone slam alaikum if you have a question uh you can put it on chat or you can ask your question directly so a question i talked about talking these days they do not do this at most funerals yeah it's a sunnah and it's something that we should revive uh because the prophet saw saddam said whoever revives the sunnah as if they have revived me or as if they have loved me it's in a different narration is that after the when the body is placed in the grave somebody calls to them and you know they say you're going to be visited by the angels the angels are going to ask you these questions what is your religion say islam is your religion what is your book say quran is your book they're going to ask you who is your prophet says muhammad is your prophet salam they're going to ask you what's your religion say islam is your religion this is called talking is you know like to to say the questions and have the deceased repeat after you because we believe that the deceased hear us but we do not hear them so this is the sunnah of the prophet and like i said it's something that we should we should revive uh so next time uh we have a death in the community insha allah i hope that i can remember or somebody can remind me and um you know we'll definitely do that when we go out to frederick or wherever we end up going for the deceased but it's a sunnah so it's not like if we don't do it it's not like we've missed something that's fundamental but it's a sunnah of the the burial process um in our will here can we distribute inheritance as per sharia yeah you can sit down with a um a lawyer and you can draft uh your your your will and and the disbursement of your or your funds the way that you want you have the right but you need to do it in consultation with a lawyer so you don't end up paying some kind of unnecessary inheritance tax uh you know these things are always changing federal state i mean i'm not up to speed with it but you know don't just take what i'm saying and like you know scribble it on a piece of paper sit with with a lawyer or maybe there's a lawyer in our community that can help us but it's important that you you do that to stipulate you have the right you know people leave all their money to like their cat i mean you know why can't we leave the money to our you know children and and folks the way we want there's nothing wrong with that would the state allow inheritance to our parents who live overseas i don't see why not i don't see why not again it's best to consult with like an estate lawyer or an estate planner or maybe even an accountant might be better uh but uh there are there the the i the general answer is i don't see why not but you have to know what is the mechanism to do that so you don't lose money by by paying some kind of unnecessary tax so definitely there's definitely a way to do it i have a little experience so you know you need to i mean i only i only have my own experience in in doing that but because i'm still alive and my wife is still alive i don't know i don't know how good that experience if we did it right or not i think inshaallah we did it right so you have to you know consult with an expert to make sure that those things are done correctly okay um can i repeat what i said about the deceased and the sunnah about questioning in the grave so this is called and it is when the body is placed in the grave we somebody would would kneel and speak to the deceased and say you are you will be visited by the angels who will ask you these questions uh what is your religion what is your book uh what is your who is your prophet and then you answer islam is my religion the quran is my etc uh so because these will these are questions that we will be asked and we pray that allah makes our tongue steady to answer correctly inshallah the hadith says we should leave a will if so it's important to remind people to do so as i know people have got into a mess with that one yes there it is a sunnah that we have a will that we do not you know spend the night several nights in a row without having a will uh and in this country you can get really really get into a very messy situation if you don't have a will and the worst thing that can happen is that the state comes in or the federal government comes in and then takes some of your stuff because you died and you didn't do things the right way and then your your children or whoever is left they're fighting with each other most of the problems that i saw when i was working in the fatwa office in cairo was because of this people are fighting over inheritance stuff even though it's a muslim majority country and even though the law is with the shadias i mean you would think that that's straightforward but even then people were fighting can you imagine what it's like here where you could do whatever you want so it's important that you you consult with somebody and you take this seriously no matter how old or young you are no matter how much money you think you have or you don't have it's it's simple and there are very you know there are famous examples of famous people who never really had a will and who things are still being litigated in the court decades after after their death and you know we don't want that uh inheritance laws perhaps one of the most complicated aspects of islamic law without going into the technical details could you give us spark notes guide on how inheritance is distributed in the sharia well it's all based on you know relative relatives and the closeness of the degree of relatives but it's like a mathematical computation and you have to know who's left standing after the person dies to determine who gets these portions um and and and it's so uh nuanced that it is considered its own discipline even though it's part of islamic law it's really considered its own discipline so i mean it's very hard to to say more than that in this type of venue um but the idea is the closer you are to this deceased the more you will get in addition depending on who you are in the family you might receive a larger portion than someone else but that might mean that you are responsible for taking care now of more people and that's another thing that needs to be kept in mind it's not just about distribution of might grab your money and you go you might have that money but you might have to be now responsible you know over your sister or or your mother or your aunt or the children or whatever so so those two things must be kept in mind at the same time so that the whole the whole system works uh why why do muslim scholars respond poorly to hd head well each jihad is is a process and there are rules and conditions and preconditions to engaging in http is an obligation and will remain an obligation until yom statistically will always be a minority of the community just like it was a minority of the sahaba only about 20 of the sahaba were much dead and because of its difficulty you know sometimes when you can't do something you just criticize it or if you're not good enough you just you just you know in anything in life you talk bad about it um but uh you know i was taught by multihead so i've seen itchy head happen it's not like this elusive unicorn i mean it's doable but it takes a lot of work and practice and you know you just have to stay at it so it's something each day is what allows our community to survive uh intellectually from generation to generation so it's it's something that is serious and it has happened and continues to happen and inshallah we pray continues to happen you just have to find the right people besides talking what else is sunnah incremental to ease the deceased's initial moments in the grave any surahs that will help their passage we recite surat yasin for the deceased uh so usually that's a practice that we do we pray for them uh we can you know distribute portions of the quran as a community and and fulfill one recitation of the quran because at the end of the recitation of the quran there's an accepted dua so we can accept that ask the reward of that go to the deceased and then pray for the deceased any pious action you know any charity all of that any of that is in the in the benefit of the deceased and that's you know something that's a good thing for us to do as a community is that we engage in in in as many of these as possible when somebody passes away uh because we hope that when we pass away that everyone else will do it for us in china can one listen to an audio recital like of the quran while on the while in the toilet no i mean not while you're doing your thing uh nor is there a need in the moments that you're in the bathroom to you know listen to quran or something but to say the sunnah expressions bismillah alhamdulillah you know things like that while you are engaging and will do in the shower are okay but i would limit it to that and you know don't don't make a habit of doing other things in in the quran brother roman is reminding me to remind you to register for jummah this friday i will be giving jummah and i have no idea what i'm going to say so if you have any recommendations let me know can a brother lead a prayer when only another person is a sister who is not related family member i think so i'm not i'm not sure i'm not sure i'd have to look that up but like if i was in the mosque and praying and then a sister came and joined my prayer i don't think there will be a problem with that i think but i could be wrong so i'm going to look that up what is the shiriya's take on serving food after the burial i think it is burial some cultures think it's a must it's a sunnah but it's a sunnah for the community to provide food for the family of the deceased we've reversed it now we as the family of the deceased provide food in addition to our grieving for the community so the idea behind it is that it's an it's an opportunity to lessen the burden of the deceased families the deceased family who are grieving and that we limit the grieving time to three days to give them some some space so it's a sunnah and that's how it should be applied so you know one way for us to do it would be like okay uh we're going to have a funeral or a receiving service at the message in the barn thursday friday and saturday because so-and-so died and then we as the community will bring the food and then the family will be there and then you can come and you can give your condolences to the family like that would be a way to do it so for the last six months alhamdulillah the uh the seniors of iccp have been reciting a judge each and and finishing the the quran or reciting the entire quran every month so that's a great practice and that's awesome and and that's you know that's what i'm talking about that's the kind of stuff that we should be engaging in uh and if we're used to doing it all the time then when we need to do it we're already used to it so it becomes easier alhamdulillah that's awesome an awesome sunnah that we've established i hope that we can do that and keep going and then brother roman put the link for the jummah registration uh inshaallah for for friday okay i think this was okay we're going to do this i believe once a month so please send in your questions whenever real came in you came in too late rihanna with this this sectarian question we'll just park that for next time because he sent it to me privately so we can we can talk about that later so the email address that has been sent out for people to send questions to feel free to send questions any time uh i welcome as many questions uh no questions off the table what i do is is before i just i print them all out and i just go through all of your questions unfiltered again they're anonymous i don't know who's asked any of these questions and this is usually how we did the islam unplugged stuff in the past so this is you should be familiar with this so we ask allah to inshallah bless us to protect us and may we all come together uh to a better understanding of our faith and may be a light in our hearts [Music] um
