so welcome everyone to our open question and answer session I have about almost 30 questions uh this evening so we'll begin inshallah these are no order of course all the questions are anonymous uh somebody wrote in and asks if I am a repeat customer at a store and they give me a refer a friend discount offer for example 25 off of a splitter can I tell my friend to use that offer to buy something for me using the 25 discount I'd pay my friend back of course is that dishonest Haram thing to do because technically I've then used the new customer offer but I'm not a new customer well there are a few ways to answer the question if the sometimes these offers there are terms uh and that's sort of the fine print so if it says in the terms specifically that you can't do something like that then that would be dishonest but if it's just a you know one of those email coupon things and you do what you said that wouldn't be dishonest as a matter of fact that might be advantageous to the store because then they're increasing their sales so unless the terms specifically say that you can't do that that it's uh single use only non-transferable that kind of language if that's the case then it would be impermissible because the prophet saws whoever tricks us is not from amongst us but as I said if it's an open situation then that would be fine a next question can we pray can we pray for people who have passed away or say Allah Allah have mercy on people who have passed who are not Muslim so we've had a question like this in the past you know about praying for people that are not Muslim what we learn from our teachers is when somebody asks this question is we remember the verse of Allah Allah says in the Quran my Mercy encompasses everything everything and everybody so the Muslim and the non-muslim the believer and the non-believer the human being in the earth and the inanimate objects so asking for Allah or somebody is not asking for Allah's forgiveness for somebody so this is the the people that ask this question are the people that think that it's Haram to send Mercy or you know you have a neighbor that died you say oh you know may Allah have mercy on them or God have mercy on them the reason they have a problem is that they are confusing the two things because of the verses in the Quran that said was forbidden for seeking is for his uncle Azar is something that Allah himself has guaranteed in the Quran and he says my Mercy encompasses everything that is not asking for is so therefore there's not a problem with that also keep in mind will intercede on all of Humanity's behalf Muslim and non-muslim he will intercede to Allah on behalf of everybody isn't this a form of rahma as well so on and so forth so we are merciful people the prophet saws said the merciful ones are given Mercy from the merciful one have mercy for all those on Earth Allah will show you the one in the heavens will show you mercy so therefore here we have a neighbor or maybe there are families in which there are mixed face and somebody passes away there's nothing wrong with asking for God's mercy and especially saying that when you're with people the family of the deceased okay next question can we do I better like Hajj or otherwise other Islamic Deeds with the intention of the reward going to the people who have passed away who are not Muslim no you can do the acts of worship for those people who are Muslims like your family or your parents or grandparents uh Etc but not for non-muslims because they did not believe in The Message of Islam or the details of Islam but rather we can ask for Allah's Mercy foreign if we encounter other Muslims who have different opinions from us in regards to Islam what course of action do you recommend is it best to give resources or links to Scholars that will obviously know more than us or try to speak from our own understanding or is it best to disengage from these discussions it depends who you are who's asking this question if you're part of our community and somebody bothers you you tell them to speak to me that's my job in this community and I take that heat and I will sit down with them and I'll talk to them politely if they're polite and not so politely if they're not so polite but if you don't know and you're just uh you know just a regular congregant and you you say your prayers and you say you're fasting and so on and so forth and then and then you meet somebody out of the blue and they tell you everything that you're doing is Haram probably the best thing is not to engage with them because you won't know where they're coming from or you could create more problems but if somebody sees you do something and they say why are you doing such and such and you say oh the Imam at our mosque taught us such and such then that's the extent of what you've referred them to the source of who taught you and that's enough in general even with my own students who study with me in general I favor disengagement because of another reason and I don't know if I've shared this story with you but I'll share the story again uh and if it's uh the first time you hear that it's the first time you hear it and I'm going to share the story without any names because you know we're not here to offend anybody but I'm using this as a teaching moment I was with uh my teacher who at the time was the Grand Mufti of Egypt we were in England attending some kind of function or conference I can't remember the exact function and there is a very prominent American Imam at the conference and it was very friendly and everything so when I was with the Sheikh me and another friend of mine we were in his room at night or having tea or something I mentioned to him an opinion that this American Imam has which is a very bizarre opinion and I you know don't want to mention it but it's it's something you know it's like saying Up Is Down and Down is up it's something very basic like that so the Sheikh looks at me is like there's no way that he says that I said no well he says such and such so the next day at dinner or at lunch uh I saw the Sheikh go sit next to this American Imam uh to talk to him about this issue and the Sheikh sat down with the amen was like no no more than like two minutes or something and then the Sheikh came back so I was like you know I want to know what happened and he looked at me he's like yeah he actually does say what you said I said and he's like I left him he's like what do you mean he left him that was the whole reason why I told you about this so you can go convince him I said why did you do that why did you leave him and he said you have to understand that this this man his whole Islam is based on this way of thinking if I try to reconstruct for him this opinion it's a fickly opinion if I try to deconstruct for him this opinion the Imam was a convert it might lead him outside of Islam he's like and we don't want to do that and he does a lot of good and many people become Muslim because of him he guides his community other than this one issue so it's best to leave him so this is a lesson that I learned early on is that when you engage with people there are two issues that you have three issues that you have to keep in mind number one is you have to have knowledge of that which you are talking about not something that you inherited or or you just assume you have to really know the detail of the issue number and that you are you just have to acquire knowledge it's not a secret number two is you have to be very careful to ascertain if this person is making a simple mistake or their entire world being is based on this way of thinking in which case you can create more of a danger and number three and most important you have to remove yourself from the equation you're not here to debate so you can feel good about yourself you're here to correct a misconception or something like that so for this reason I advise even my students even those that study with me I advise them not to engage at all until they are ready to sit and teach and whatnot so if those are students of knowledge and I remember when I was a student and I still am a student in many respects very rarely would we engage because every time we come to engage I ask myself do I know all of the issues all of the opinions or is there an opinion that I don't know even the Shia opinions is there a Shia dispensation for this act or not I said well I don't know I have to go look it up so I feel like I don't want to engage and for the people in the congregation to repeat if people are within our family The Wider iccp family you can always refer them back to me and that's my role uh amongst you and Shah one of my roles amongst you inshallah okay you have mentioned uh before that people in successful Muslim relationships will have shared fundamental principles what are some ways that we could see if a potential partner shares our principles what are some specific topics or questions that you think should be discussed before marriage well usually the principles can be ascertained through through uh occurrences and and incidents so when you go to somebody's house or you go out together or you're buying this or you know just in the interaction that's where you can determine how somebody's principles like for example is somebody stingy or generous you can you can read especially women are very good at this they can read or do they bring a gift to the house or they don't bring a gift at all or do they bring a gift from Trader Joe's or do they bring a gift from Whole Foods or do they bring flowers or did they pluck flowers from your front yard or so you know I mean you can tell about what they bring if there's they're generous and then maybe there's a family gathering and you go out so I'm just giving an example about this quality of being generous of stingy uh again some people that are stingy it's not that they're stingy but they're Frugal for example maybe they come from a simple background and you know they're saving everything to get married and things like that so you also have to understand the background of the person but it's through those occurrences through talking and through doing certain things together that you will be able to learn so don't underestimate that also just speaking about you know what do you want from a family what's important for you what are you looking for what are you studying what do you do things like that based on people's answers you can tell there used to be a science called animal farasa the science of ferrasa says that you could look at somebody's face and know everything about them and uh he was one of the people who was very good at this so when I learned because I'm a chef and when I learned this I wanted to I was like oh if I can learn how to read people's faces and I'll be a master I can so I told my shift I said I want to learn and he laughed at me he's like that doesn't exist anymore because of the chemicals that we consume and the medicines that we take and the the you know GMOs and food and and the cell phones and we have our futures as human beings have changed but there used to be the ability that if a man or let's say I'm I want to get married my mother sister Aunt Etc could look could look at a woman's face and just by her basic natural features no almost everything about her physical qualities and her character traits so we might not be able to do that looking at people's faces now but we can observe how people function in different circumstances and then deduce from that some of their principles in addition asking you know the fundamental questions about family children rearing you know so on and so forth it's a big question I mean we need a class on on marriage and relationships it's kind of hard to do this in just one sitting we'll do that inshaallah after Ramadan some Nifty say even wishing someone Merry Christmas is forbidden yeah what kind of Mufti is going to say that he's not a Mufti he's a Google Mufti also in this country we do not want to alienate our kids kids for Christmas and New Year favorites festivities sorry so we also have Christmas trees in the house and Santa comes in the night leaves gifts is this forbidden my kid asked me if Santa was a Muslim and I replied maybe I don't know I said Santa is a secret my kid insisted that Santa was a Muslim as he wore a cap I'll be we had a good laugh actually and everybody was happy we exchanged gifts at Ramadan and give sweets to our non-muslim neighbors and my neighbors bring us gifts and sweets in Diwali surely we can give Christmas gifts can't we this question uh falls under a larger topic which is can we wish people of other faiths good wishes and happy holidays during their special times so what do we find in the Sunnah of the Prophet saws this is a very simple question when the prophet saws came to Medina when the prophet saws came to Medina he entered into Medina in so he left Mecca at the end of Safar and he entered Medina and rabiel erwan on his birthday Etc all the way to the next year the maharam is the first year of the month so 11 months later in Muharram when he came he found the Jews of Medina fasting on a specific day so he asked the Jews of Medina why are you fasting on this day so they said this is the day that Allah saved Musa uh Moses and Benny Israel from pharaoh so we fast out of Thanksgiving and what did the prophet saws said he said we have more of a right to Moses than you because he is a prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so he ordered the Muslims to fast and this is the fast of Ashura of course after that came the fast of Ramadan and the fast of Ashura became a sinner but the mentality of the Prophet sallallahu is he would see these signs and he sees Musa he is what I find every year around this time when people ask this question not just in this community but anywhere else I believe I was thinking about this this morning when I was when I got the questions I believe the big problem is that many Muslims don't comprehend that these are our prophets too not that we yeah yeah we believe in Jesus and Musa but we but we we love them too Allah says in the Quran we do not distinguish between the and beyah even though we love saying number one of course but when we hear the name of Christ so on and so forth these are our NBA so if there's something that honors those prophets we're going to honor them too and if there's something to celebrate those prophets we're going to celebrate them too but we're going to celebrate them in our way and honor them in our way so when it comes to things like that particularly when it comes to Judaism and Christianity because these are the two I mean Christianity is really a subsect of Judaism from the from the point of view of the history of religions all of these MBA are in the or most of those MBA are in the Quran when it comes to non-abrahamic Faith it's a little bit difficult we'll talk about that in a second but specifically when it comes to Judaism and Christianity like for example when I'm when I do the Interfaith stuff and I meet these rabbis in the area I tell them you know we celebrate the Passover too because these are stories that are in the Quran so the mentality that the believer has is this mentality of trying to mend any type of differences that may occur so what is Christmas Christmas is the day that Christians celebrate the birth of Christ so that's a day that we not only do we celebrate but Allah mentions it in the Quran on the tongue is Christ in the Quran is quoted as saying peace be on me the day I was born the day I will be I will die and the day I will return or the day I was raised in the day I will return so the specific day of the Milad of Islam is mentioned so if a billion Christians pick a certain date now obviously he wasn't born on that day we know that that date was chosen for other political reasons when the Roman Empire became Christian and they were trying to do away with Pagan practices but that's not we don't know the birth of any of the MBA except Satan Muhammad but if this is the day that you fight a billion people on earth or over a billion people celebrating Christ Christ There's an opportunity for us to say that we we believe in Christ too and we honor Christ and then we remind ourselves of why do we love him why do we honor him this old chapter in the Quran about Mary alaihissalam so on and so forth as far as the way Christmas tree and things like that I wouldn't do that personally I'm not going to say it's Haram because Haram is a serious word but I wouldn't do that because we have our own way so we can create our own way of doing this celebration whether we talk about it whether we celebrate the way we do the Milad of the mouth the same thing so I would not follow the customs the Christmas tree specifically there's no real religious symbolism behind it I mean you definitely can't go to church and go to mass that's Haram because that's an act of worship but if your neighbor invites you you can go sit in the back and just observe that's different but you can't participate in the act of a worship that doesn't that's not Islamic but the truth itself and things like that those are just you know Nordic culture it has nothing to do with the religion uh as far as other religion uh other uh non-abrahamic faiths like dharmic religions Hindus Buddhists Etc same thing the Muslims encountered these religions it's not like this is the first time we hear about them when the Muslims were in India for over a thousand years uh they encountered this and more and all of those Buddhist and Hindu temples and The Vedas all of those were preserved under the auspices of Muslim rule so obviously the Muslims knew what was going on so there is this coexistence and this perspective of respect but we do not merge our faith into their faith just like they're not going to merge their faith into our faith everyone has their own distinct religion but when we understand what the many many other met consider uh The Vedas to be the books of Ibrahim Ibrahim the books of Abraham and Moses some of not many some of the other men say that Ibrahim in in one of the recitations of the of the Quran ibrahima Veda and they say oh The Vedas are the books of Ibrahim there's nothing wrong with adopting this view because it doesn't change our religion and we know that there are prophets that were sent before that we don't know their names so on and so forth so we respect all of those organized religions as The Wider concept of people of the book and therefore our perspective towards them should be good faith and and good neighborly conduct and uh finding points that can overlap inshaallah however the question also brings up something else which is the fact that we are a minority in this country and that's why it's important that when it comes to our own holidays we make the effort to celebrate them as much as we can one time at this mosque when I first started it it happened to be that that jummah was the first day of Muharram sorry I wasn't at this mosque it was in another mosque and they didn't ask me to come back but that's okay and I I said it's the New Year's and I talked about how in some Muslim cultures they they'll make like white cookies with white powdered sugar so that the ear will be full of white and good and you know it's just like a cultural thing and they put up lights and oh man people got so many this is about Muharram our new year I wasn't talking about the January 1st Junior I was talking about our new year and people got offended well that's how we are that we're going to end up getting questions like this because if our kids if I eat for our kids is having Dunkin Donuts in a parking lot in a mall and that's it and then for a whole month it's all this you know jingle bell jingle bell stuff outside then it's going to be very hard for them to feel something when it comes to our holidays so when it comes to our holidays we should celebrate and embellish and we do have this mosque alhamdulillah thank you okay easier question does diabetic prick test break your wudu no it does not break your Urdu and it also does not break your fasting if you take an insulin shot intramuscular shots do not break your fast but intervenous shots break your fast because the veins and the arteries are considered by the Sharia to be inside the body um so you can't draw blood or you can't have a IV while you're well you can if you need it of course but you break your fast but if you have the insulin shot that's intramuscular that is permissible so it doesn't break you'll do and it doesn't break your fast usually during the silent prayers different us we recite Asura silently without the knowledge of which Surah the Imam recites and when the Imam says Allahu Akbar we go to rukua we follow the Imam but we have not finished the Surah please clarify reciting the Surah after the fat is a Sunnah so you don't have to do that but the Imam you have to follow because the prophet saws the imam's job is that you follow the Imam in prayer so after you finish the fatah you start you know another Surah uh maybe you even say Bismillah says Allah you say Allah Akbar and then you go now if you are reciting the fat and the Imam says Allahu Akbar and you haven't finished the fact then you stand you remain standing to finish the fatah and then you go into rukua of course for the hanafis they don't do that they just follow the Imam but this is for the shepheres and and the others so if the Imam is quick and you don't get a chance to recite your second Surah at all or partially that's fine some imams recite the tahit recital quickly is a shorter version from the minimum salary that's the shortest thing that you can do so if you are in the last raka and the Imam says salaam salaam and you still are going you take your time because you're still in prayer and there's nothing else to catch up to if it's the second raka of uh meaning that there's another raqqa after that you're going to say the first part until the shahada and then you're going to stand so if you're a little lagging behind that's okay too and and tell the Imam me or whoever that you're too fast the Imam should accommodate that foreign in cold medicine okay to take it's even found in children's medication medicines in general the Sharia is very liberal when it comes to medication specifically when it comes to alcohol and medication the alcohol that's in medication is not placed in the medication with the purposes of getting drunk skipping the purpose other has other Pharma pharmacological purposes so from that point of view it's okay to take the medic medicine if it's prescribed especially if it alleviates pain it helps with an illness Etc it is permissible to take substances that the Sharia considers nudges ritually impure as medication because there are Hadith that indicate like the urine of the coward so my urine is considered nudges but there's a Hadith about taking it for medical purposes so that Hadith is especially in the chef I met up is important to understand this question in addition there are different types of alcohol is a chemical family a family of compounds ethanol alcohol is the alcohol that is Haram to consume other forms of alcohol methylene and whatever I wasn't very good at chemistry so I'm not going to even pretend like I know what they are there are enough medical people in the room um those substances are they do not take the same ruling as ethanol alcohol like the alcohol that you find in gasoline or something like that it might be Haram to consume gasoline but for another purpose because you're going to die not because it's poisonous not because it's going to get you drunk but it takes a different ruling than the specific the hammer that we have in the Sharia so that's one thing to note also the the alcohol that's in the medicine is a small portion usually a small portion of the out it's not like you know 99 proof vodka you know that's no that's that's obvious you can't you're not going to do that but if it's cough syrup and the like furthermore we take medicine that's even more intensive we take narcotics when people are in pain they take narcotics I mean it's even more potent and dangerous than the alcohol and even that's permissible uh with the prescription of a physician if you're in serious pain and the like okay if a woman has missed two ramadans due to pregnancy or nursing is she required to make it up all before the next Ramadan when she is planning to fast it you had said previously that giving money was not the proper way to make up fasting there's a difference of opinion the opinion that we give which is the easier opinion is that you just simply have to make it up it doesn't have to be made up before the next Ramadan so it's a difference of opinion but I always give the easier uh uh opinion because you know when you're fat when you're pregnant or you're nursing you you know you're gonna miss 30 60 90 days so sometimes it's hard to make all of those up before the next Ramadan so as long as you just are on a steady schedule of making up your fasts uh you're going to be okay inshallah foreign question I'm not going to read it all but I'm going to give you the highlights of it given the importance Islam maintains gives to maintain family relations are there exceptions to why someone may cut communication with a sibling is there any religious obligation of one sibling to another if there's a tremendous amount of unwarranted verbal and psychological abuse taking place and then she goes on to mention a sister who they think is mentally not well she married a non-muslim her kids are not Muslims and there's sort of a distance between them so first of all every time we have a problem with somebody we can't just say the problem the other person has a mental problem okay that's not going to work because if by that token all of us have mental problems so let's just avoid you know that determination is for the doctors uh let's just say that you have a sibling in which there's you know every time you get together or you talk it's it's very negative and very bad there are it's not black and white first of all don't put yourself in a situation where you don't have any contact at all with your family because that's one of the drawbacks of living in the western world is that the Western World can be very individualistic and you can end up living alone even though you're surrounded by people you're actually alone and then you find yourself alone the prophet saws warned us against that and he he disliked that people would go live in the bed yeah go live in the desert by themselves he didn't like that even though there were some sahaba that did that because that maybe there were unique situations but in general we are meant to live in community and that's what Aristotle said that man is a political animal meaning that we are meant to live in community not live by ourselves the prophet saws said also maintaining Family Ties increases in your wealth and increases in your life it increases in your life either that it adds to your life or it adds bread length to your life or it adds breadth to your life but there is great Baraka in being with your family and maintaining ties so don't think about it as black or white you can send them a message you can send them an email you can send them a card in the holiday times or Ramadan you can send you can send them you write them a letter by hand you can you can mail it to them you can mail them a care package there are many ways to keep the relationship but don't be the person that doesn't you know contact especially she's married to a non-muslim which is not permissible her kids are not Muslim which is obviously not good maybe you are the will be the reason why they will cut back to Islam eventually so don't think about it black or white oh this my sister is crazy I can never talk she has mental issues I mean that you're not a doctor to make that determination because I'm sure that she thinks the same thing about you too so let's look at the gray there are different ways uh but if every time you talk to somebody they hit you and they spit in your face well obviously you're not going to talk to them I mean so you you will you'll have a different type of relationship with that person that's understandable but pray for them at least make Dwight for them don't cut off the the internal relationship with a family member especially if it's a first order family member like a sibling a parent a child Etc okay during burial uh please clarify if the deceased body has to be placed on Raw Earth some countries only allow vaults and cemented walls what's the general practice please the Sunnah is that we bury you know in from Earth we come in from Earth that we return Allah created us from the genetic material that is the same genetic material of Earth and and we are and we return to that so the sun is that we are buried in the earth shrouded and buried in the earth now in many uh States like in this state we have to have a cement Vault inside the ground inside the grave plot for environmental purposes and the cement vault is very big it's it can accommodate two three people if you put them side by side for example so it's a very wide thing so all we do is we put Earth in the cement vault and then after we lay the body down on the right side then we fill the cement Vault with Earth the cement vault is closed and then we fill up the grave so we fulfill the Sun and that's that's fine as a matter of fact there are other varial practices in Egypt you would be shocked to know which is really shocking if to see it because of the high water table in Egypt and Cairo because of the Nile we are not able to bury the normal way but rather each family has a room under the ground that is opened and reopened every time someone dies and there are steps that go down and the men are on the right the men are on the left you just lie the body down put some dirt on them and you go it's very freaky I mean really really scary but in the books of fish it will say you know except the graves of Egypt right because there are there's an environmental issue uh like that or what if you're in the Nordic countries and it's all ice and you can't bury you might have to put it in a vault to be able to put it under the ground so there are dispensations because of the way the Earth is and things like that but the basic Sunnah is that we want the body to be shrouded in the in the grave and surrounded by Earth because that's where we come from In some cultures while the body is shrouded fully with two pieces of white cloth a mound of Earth is placed by the cheek for the face to rest is this a must oh what happens it's not true I'm not trying to be so morbid but if you do this law if you do this enough you'll understand that the the the dead body it's not super I mean it's flexible but it's it's heavy and the person's dead they can't move for you so when you put the body in the grave you have to prop the body up so that it lies towards the on its right side as much as possible especially the head facing the Qibla so usually what we do is on the left side we put Earth X like a pillow of dirt or a stone or something like that to help prop the body up uh so that it's facing uh so that's really what's happening it's not about dirt on the right cheek you know the the body is shrouded the the head is covered and then the feet are covered so it's kind of like a candy wrapper and there are two wraps on the top and the bottom so you don't see any part of the body and we don't expose the body after we bury the body in the Earth but we do our best to tilt the body towards the right so it faces the Qibla which is why it's important to make sure that you have uh you know afterlife plans and that you have a burial plot in a Muslim Cemetery because when you go to a Muslim Center a lot of these things are taken care of for you but if you don't and you're stuck going to a non-muslim cemetery the grave might not be on the Qibla at all and that that could be problematic could a spouse be allowed privately to view the body of a deceased while the body is being shrouded or after in this case the spouse was not present when the person passed away she was deeply aggravated that she did not get a chance to see the body and was not permitted to see the body even after shouting with Elders saying that will do is performed on the deceased will get nullified in the Sunni tradition to this day the spouse is bitter about this there are a couple of things with this question number one what I have seen is that people confuse the after death process they confuse themselves for the deceased the the job the minute somebody dies in the community we want to do everything we can for the person who has passed away not so we can feel good about ourselves the to honor the dead in Islam is to bury them as soon as possible is to wash them shroud them and bury them as soon as possible it is very common in Muslim cultures that many family members are not present during that process because people might be far away but what's is it they will feel bad the living but what matters is the person who died not that I feel good that I was there or not there what matters is that we do right by that person that we do all of these things as soon as possible so I have found that many people that get emotional is because they confuse they're really I mean I I hate it sounds so I really don't mean any offense to anyone but they're very selfish they think it's about them they are sad they are upset they want to speak and let everyone know but it's not about you it's about the person who you know praying the geneza on and burying we have to do right by them there's an order of things then after that then we can you know assuage our own feelings but somebody's gonna have to wash the body somebody's gonna have to shroud it someone's gonna have to bring it to the message that we pray that we're gonna have to drive it to the cemetery and bury it and do all of these things in the Talquin and this and that make sure that there's a headstone there so we know where the person is then we can look to the living so that's where everyone it's very as hard as it is to hear please and this is a reminder for myself you know God forbid if I find myself in that situation I would want you to share remind me of it too it's not about me it's about the person uh who has died that being said it's permissible for the wife to see or a family member to see the face of the deceased after they have died because the Sidney Allah between his eyebrows after he passed you remove the recovering from his face and he kissed him he said tip how beautiful you are alive and how beautiful you are dead so that's permissible you know if we can catch it if it's you know right at the washing time or in the hospital or something like that but don't take the body all the way to the cemetery and then be like oh somebody's face timing from you know Timbuktu and we have to because this has happened these are real stories that's not appropriate because it's about it's not about the living it's about the dead so you can see the face you know let's say up until the time of the Janessa prayer uh shortly right after the geneza prayer but once we start moving to the burial we want to get the person buried that's how we honor the Dead uh we honor the dead by burying them as soon as possible as far as the women being bitter we can talk to her another problem with the question the way it's phrased is that we also misunderstand death death is not the end of life but death is moving from one mode of living to another mode of living so even the deceased in our community our loved ones our families even the people before us we can have a relationship with them it's not going to be like this kind of relationship which you can make Dwight for them you can pray for them you can read Quran for them you can do charity on their behalf you can remember them uh we can gather together and read the Quran you know each one of us can read a Jews and we do a khatam for them so on and so forth we could read the essene for them we can go to the grave and visit them so on and so forth so this is also something for us to to remember and to be uh we have to accept the fact that when Allah calls somebody home that's Allah's will and we can't change that and we have to accept that and we ask Allah to make it easy on us inshallah I'm not trying to make it seem it's not easy I know it's hard uh but I'm trying for us to think about having the right way of thinking about it so we don't get caught up in the me moment because it's it's really I guess really the only way to say it is sometimes people's true selfishness shows at the time of death and we have to remember that we want to honor the dead it's not about us okay can a Muslim and not sorry non-muslim men be allowed to view the face of a woman deceased after shrouding and why would they want to see that what is the this what's this obsession with seeing people dead people Halas we shrouded the people let's bury them people you know I mean if it's in the hospital or something like that or at home it's one thing but after we've washed the body and we've shrouded them let's just move on with it I think this comes in the western tradition of the um the wake right where they you go to the funeral home and you pay them a pretty penny and you they put on a good suit and they pump you with whatever they pump you with and then you just sit there look at the dead body we don't do that because that's not how we honor the dead we honor the dead by bearing them recital at the grave is a son of the Prophet saws that he said that when uh when somebody passes and you put them in the grave somebody will stand and call them by their mother's name people say oh you the son of and you mentioned the person's mother's name and if you don't know the mother's name then you say oh you Son of Eve son of hawet and you remind him that the angels are gonna why do you do this because the person's alive that's the whole point it's a different kind of life but the person is listening to you so you're telling the angels are going to come and ask you what is your religion say Islam is my religion what is your book Quran is my book who is this man Satan Muhammad you know what who is your lord Allah is my Lord you know we're going to be asked these questions and inshallah we ask Allah that we may answer them easily and without difficulty so that's what the Talquin is it is to stand and to to speak to the Dead uh uh uh linking them to their mother and coaching them basically is against the right word through these questions inshallah a young friend of ours who is also who also prays five times a day decided that she did not want to get married but wanted to have a kid so she decided to go for in vitro fertilization is this religiously permissible her defense is that she did not indulge in any illicit relations but is taking advantage of science when the child is born and attains the age of 18 the child will be told who the father is this is Haram Haram Haram three times just so we can be clear about that you can't do that because the only way you can have a child that's recognized in the Sharia is through marriage and then the constant the sexual consummation of that marriage even if the couple can't conceive and they want to have uh in in vitro fertilization it has to be from the genetic matter of the couple not can involve a third person you can't take my sperm my wife's egg and put it inside and get a third person or a fourth person the child has to have two sets you know one set of each parent that's it for the child to be considered uh legitimate in the eyes of the Sharia just because something is doable does not mean that it's permissible so just because we can do something like this it doesn't mean that it's spirit this is very Haram and a huge you know mistake we asked the sister to uh you know make taoba and and I I don't know how far along she is or any of that I'm not going to get involved in those type of details how about adopting a child how about taking a child into your care from the gazillion Muslim orphans that we have roaming around the earth how about that that's that's a solution you can do that and have a you know a cafe taking care of an orphan the prophet saws praise is a huge uh the prophet saws me and the one who sponsors an orphan it will be like this in the paradise it's a great Hadith that's a great act so there are other ways of doing it so this is not permissible at all in the Sharia and it has a the child according to shriya cannot uh claim uh lineage to the father even if the father becomes known in the city that's called ibnazina you know the son of fornication it's really a horrible a horrible horrible thing to have to carry so that's not permissible the next question is actually related if the married couple decided together to get IVF done is they cannot have kids what is the opinion of The Scholar is as I said if it involves both of them then that's fine but you can't involve a third person or a fourth or a fifth person is there an explanation other than a Sunnah as to why are read silently we pray the way that the prophet saws prayed pray the way you have seen me pray he said sallallahu so there's no necessarily rational you can maybe come up with a wisdom behind it but the the answer to the question is that we do it because that's what the prophet saws does or did and our doing it shows our faith in him and our following him so not everything in in our religion is going to be a reasonable like why can't we eat pig meat I really don't know because there are other foods that are filthy that we eat that are perfectly permissible but Allah told us not to touch this so we say okay we we do we won't touch that so on and so forth what is the origin of the tashahood from the story of the Israel and the marriage uh would you uh would you again explain if the prophet saws is alive or dead in a special state of being different from others who have passed the prophet saws is alive in his grave as or is which is our belief as is all of the MBA uh the prophet saws he said when I went to Jerusalem I saw Moses praying by the Red Sand Dune and if you were with me I would have shown him to you amen by haki the famous Hadith scholar he has a book about the life of the MBA in their grave so all of the MBA plural are alive in their graves uh Allah has also forbidden the Earth to decompose the bodies of the MBA that's also part of our belief we believe that when we send salaam to the prophet saws he responds back to us in the tashahud we directly speak to the prophet saws peace be unto you o Prophet or uh the calf hears because you're speaking to somebody directly so and the many many Hadith that speak to that so that's our that's our belief regarding rasulullah so and all of the MBA why is it Abraham and could we salute a few other prophets if we want oh in the tahit the prayer is not the uh space for creativity the prayer is the space for obedience we ought to be creative we can be creative outside of the prayer but when it comes so I'm not going to take the Quran and be like you know what I'm going to add a verse here I'm going to add a verse there it's there's no creativity you just memorize it and read it the way it is the prayer is you do it the way it is because it's an act of obedience if you want to uh have a special prayer for all of the MBA you can do that after prayer that's fine but not inside the prayer inside the prayer is the time that we follow what the prophet saws told us to do how is getting married to your cousin permissible in Islam when there is research that suggests children born from these relationship have birth defects due to this permissible is one thing but it's not necessarily recommended exactly for this reason marriage is one of those things that's regulated by religion it's another thing that we forget in other systems of belief in other cultures and other times people married their siblings or people married parents or or whatnot I mean even in some American extreme sects of Mormonism and whatnot that's that so happens you know that type of incestuous relationship still happens which is why we have clear verses in the Quran telling us who we can marry and whom we can't marry so it is something that is legislated by the Divine and this is one of the reasons behind many of the not allowing cross uh religious marriages even for Muslim men so okay it's permissible but doesn't don't I I somebody came and asked me I would not recommend it but there are cultures in which it's very common um and uh not only is it common but it's a way that you know people can easily get married and it avoids you know these long drawn out you know never-ending engagements and things like that I'm not advocating for it but I'm saying there are there is a place for it and it happens uh and the Sharia is here to speak to all these different modes not just to what we think like in our cultural understanding it might not make sense but we can't deny that it's permissible why were the angels and shaytan told to prostrate to Adam this seems like even though I know that it cannot be right if only Allah is supposed to be prostrated to In Worship why did this happen similarly the story of prophet Yusuf alaihissalam and the stars prostrating to him why did these events happen because these are prostitution prostration of gratitude and honoring which the Sharia has forbidden other than to Allah so before the Advent of Islam it was a sign of respect for honoring not not only a sign of worship uh I remember when I was doing some work with some Nigerians they told me that there are some tribes even Muslim tribes till today where it's common that when they see an elder they make sujud in front of the Elder now I mean that's from the Sharia point where that's impermissible you can't do that but that shows you that it's an inherited practice among some people as a sign of respect so Adam Iblis Yusuf Ali these are signs of respect not of worship Islam has our Islam the Islam of came to confine that act to limit it only to worship so we cannot prostrate to one another uh nor should we ever prostrate to anyone other than to Allah in prayer and then lastly well there are some questions a couple here but the last one for the the pre-sent questions probably the most important question of the night is a hair transplant surgery permissible I think many people go to Turkey to have this done isn't this changing the creation of Allah why do you want to hurt people's feelings changing the creation of Allah and your wife wants you to get a hair transplant no that's permissible there's nothing wrong with it actually when I went to Turkey in October I had uh shaved my head as many of you knew in the summer and everyone in my family was very upset so I was forced to let it grow back so when I was in turkey and my hair was growing back I looked like I was one of those people that had the surgery so my kids kept making fun of me and on the you know you go to Turkey and everyone's fine but on the flight back you know half the flight is that's fine because because it's your natural hair and what's not permissible is to wear a wig because that's false but the the hair transplanted your own hair that's that's fine what's yesterday oh my God that was yesterday was it yesterday oh subhanallah yesterday oh subhanallah but we also often asked me through can we suppose you can you can combine the prayers for no reason so if you joined us yesterday and you pray to us and you weren't going to go to the cemetery that's fine there's it's there's nothing wrong with that but the reason I did that is because I don't know what time you guys came back but I I came back like 4 4 15. but I mean there was only 20 minutes that's okay it's because no it's okay that you pray to us because that's permissible there's an opinion in the Sharia that says that you can combine your prayers even if you're not traveling even if it's not raining that's okay so that's fine I should have mentioned that yesterday but one time when we did this we had a burial in I think it was November December and we didn't pray us and I remember I almost miss us because it's freezing to pray out there in the summit it's just very very cold and they don't want you to stay they want you to we had two barrels yesterday I got out of the car and I stood with all these people and then 10 minutes I don't know who these people are I was like actually what mosque are you from he's like oh we're from ICM I was like ah wrong burial so I went back into the car and then I saw the other I don't know these are this is our death you know so the guy he wanted to like for us to finish so anyway that's why I did it I have uh one question uh our family recently experienced a big disappointment not involving life and death relationship or loss of wealth alhamdulillah but a disappointment nonetheless what would be the best way to respond in the moment as well as after some time has passed you know disappointment uh Allah teaches us patience through it and also teaches us lessons of Reliance because oftentimes when I'm disappointed with something what I'm really disappointed in is that I was attached to an outcome I want this and that I didn't get this so now I'm disappointed but I mean you know I I it's there's really nothing to be disappointed about I wanted something and Allah didn't want it to happen so I mean I know I'm trivializing it I was you're probably a big situation but if you can understand that example then you can understand basically all of our disappointments are that I wanted to marry this person and it didn't work out I wanted it I want I was attached to an outcome but Allah didn't want that outcome now I wanted to get married to this person and I got married to this person I'm very happy right I'm very happy because I got what I wanted or am I happy because Allah put someone in my path to get married it was a difference so on and so forth so the biggest lesson of disappointment and look disappointment is disappointing it sucks it's not good we feel bad that when we're disappointed we're upset and that's the point the point is Allah is teaching us only rely on me don't rely on you or don't rely on so-and-so or don't rely on a certain outcome but rely on me and me alone and don't think that any disappointment that you face Allah will not compensate you for it later he might compensate you in this world with something better or he might save it for you which will which we which is better for us in the long run on the in the Hereafter Allah will never let anything that we do go to waste no action that we do no good work that we do no smile that we've made or helping hand that we've learned nothing will go to waste it will all be reserved for us and preserved for us so sometimes the disappointment is for us to reflect on these things and turn to Allah and we ask Allah to help you and your family and all everyone else who's going through difficulty we ask Allah to help us all insha Allah uh there's no more questions we're going to pray now right okay he was
