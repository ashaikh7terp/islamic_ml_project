Okay. Welcome everyone to our open Q&A forum. Uh everyone should be used to this uh setup by now. Uh all of the questions that I've received are anonymous and they are in no particular order. Uh there are not many questions but many of the questions are are kind of heavy I would say. So let's begin inshallah and I hope that I can do justice uh and answer them. Now of course many of the questions are like a paragraph. I don't think it's I'm going to read the whole paragraph but I will summarize the question uh because sometimes people put in a lot of extra information. Okay. The first question is about a state 529 uh savings account. Of course, there are uh there are state and federal type of uh financial instruments in which people put money in those accounts and those accounts are earmarked for their children's educational funds and educational expenses. So the question is about putting money in those accounts for tuition etc. um and the zaka implications on that. So one of the fundamental uh obligate one of the fundamental conditions for paying zak is what we call full ownership full ownership means that I have money in my pocket and I can take it out and I can give it to you or I can put it back etc. That's full ownership. These accounts are not full ownership. They are specific to a person to a person, but they are not because they are shrouded with sort of laws and parameters. For example, if you don't use them for what they're used, what they're intended use for, it's okay, but you're penalized. All of those type of things like the uh 401k accounts means that you have lost that condition of full ownership. So no matter how much money that money is uh in those accounts there is no zak on them as long as you're going to use them for the educational cost. Now if the money acrru so much for example you don't use them for the uh educational purposes and you withdraw them after you withdraw them and after you pay the penalties then you can start thinking about if you've reached a certain amount you pay the zaka but as it stands those type of accounts there's no zaka on them. Likewise, I I can't remember the name of the accounts or the number, but there are similar accounts for health um health savings as well. Do you know the name? HSA. Yeah. So, yeah. So, those type of accounts also you wouldn't pay any zaka on them. Okay. Next question. Somebody's asking for a recommendation of a book that provides clear interpretation of the verses of the Quran but not in depth. Okay. So, is a whole ocean you know of of a topic and uh there are many many you know there are dozens and dozens and dozens of taps and there are of different categories and there are different stripes and different flavors and different meds. There are Sunni taps and Shia tsiers. There's mazesite. There's philosophical Sufi so on and so forth. So you have to understand that one is not really enough if you really want to understand a verse. You need at least you know four or five to kind of get a sense of the verse. But to answer the person's question, I just kind of want to know what the verse is talking about without it being too indepth. I would recommend the Ib because it's easily accessible. It's sound. Ibn Kafir does tap by the hadith and by the Quran itself. So he usually just finds the strongest narrations of hadith about a certain set of verses. So usually when you read it, you will find out why if there's a story of why a sequence of verses was revealed. If there's some difficulties in the language, the hadith will explain it and it's pretty straightforward. Keeping in mind that that's also limiting in the sense that there are other many many other things that Ib Kafir does not cover. So for the purpose of the questioner, a go-to would be Ib to answer those simple questions. I also highly recommend elaps.com alts.com. It's a a website that my organization in Jordan uh runs and it has uh most of the great taps in their original language and many of them that are available in translation form. They're in translation form. It also has at least I think 20 English translations that you can just cycle in the translations of the various verses. It's a very good resource uh and it's accessible you know from their phone and things like that. The third question somebody asked about time management. Of course, this is a larger topic, but time management basically is, you know, the the elusive uh the elusive prize in all our lives because our our time is is uh is in short supply, it seems. I think one of the ways to think about time management is to schedule important things. So, sometimes it's as simple as just scheduling. Many of us don't and we want to do things tomorrow and the day after, but we rarely schedule them. So for me the first step towards time management is the idea of I have to schedule things. If something is important and I need to do it even if it's reading or like in my case I have to prepare for this session or I have to prepare for Juma or whatever I also have to schedule when I'm going to prepare for it. So that so sometimes people don't think that they have to schedule that but you have to schedule that and you have to block it out. The second thing is the importance of sleeping early and waking up early. uh most of the people that I deal with this is their number one problem. People do not sleep uh on you know they don't get good sleep or they don't sleep enough hours or they don't sleep the right hours. The earlier you sleep the better. The earlier you wake the better. The hours in the beginning of the day are much more valuable than the hours in the middle and the end of the day. It's like the the quality of the time diminishes throughout the day because you get busy and things like that. But if you start your day at 5 or 6:00 in the morning, then you know those first couple hours you have very clear head to do the things you need. You can actually accomplish quite a lot in just two hours in in the early morning than you probably could in in almost the whole working day. The third thing is a uh from time management point of view is something that we can benefit from the people of of tas which is the idea of uh a weird. A weird is is a litany, a dedicated time that you have to doing some devotional work. So you have a w of the Quran. So every day after I'm going to read a portion of the Quran, for example, we call that a w. If you take that concept and you apply it to everything that you need to do and you convert everything into this idea of a wid that I'm dedicated to doing it at a certain time, you have a higher chance of accomplishing the things that you need to accomplish. Now the thing about the a that concept is let's say every morning at 7 in the morning I'm going to read that's what I'm going to dedicate and then I wake up in the morning and then something happens there's a problem in the house the kids this the that and I I find that it's 7:30 and I didn't I didn't do it. So the philosophy of the w is you've missed it that's okay you move on with your day and then the next day you get it in the sense that if you've missed that portion of time what you've dedicated yourself to doing and you find yourself in a new chunk of time in that new chunk of time there's another obligation that you have to do so in that chunk of time you have to do that obligation and you've simply missed it and that kind of gives you the sense that okay I I had scheduled to do it I had intended to do it didn't happen inshallah I'll get to it the next day and and you don't have to dwell over missing it and say I'm going to do it and squeeze it and then everything gets pushed and stacked and then the day becomes uh becomes a mess. So those three things is the idea of scheduling things even if they're mundane even if they're phone calls um uh reviewing sometimes you should just schedule thinking time taking a walk I mean if you schedule it then you're going to manage it and you're going to do it number two is getting the right hours of sleep early sleep early to bed early to rise and number three carving up the day in different chunks of time in which you are going to dedicate to doing the certain tasks that are important for you along the ways that I mentioned try those three things and I think you'll will be able to get quite far inshallah. Okay, this question is from a sister who asks about I know it's a sister because of the question about that often times she has the Quran being played in the house and she's moving about but she's not covered. Uh is this disrespectful or is this sinful? So a woman covering herself or a man for that matter while reading the Quran or listening to the Quran is not a condition for listening to the Quran. Covering your nakedness is a condition for prayer for the salah for the nam not for listening or not for the prophetam did in all modes of his life in any and there was never a moment in his time in which he did not make when it comes to the Quran the only thing that you can't do is you can't be in a state of janaba or major ritual impurity and recite the Quran out loud that's that's it but other than that a woman doesn't have to wear the hijab or doesn't have to cover or likewise as a man it's not a condition for uh listening to the Quran reading the Quran thinking about the Quran and in general one should not get in the habit of allowing anything to distance themselves from a relationship with the Quran so if you find yourself thinking oh I want to read the Quran but usually shaitan is kind of behind that butt and you should be careful next question is about the chronology of the revelation of the Quran, the suras and the verses etc. Uh the scholars oful are in a consensus as Ibas argued he died in the year 338 that it is impossible for us to know the entire chronology of the Quran. So in other words you can't know this was the first verse revealed second third fourth fifth all the way from the very beginning and to the end. In other words, you can't recreate a Quran that is in chronological form. We do know when some things were revealed and some chunks of verses of course like we know that the first few verses of that of that surah was the first revelation. I mean there's no difference about that. But even um you know what's the last verse revealed or the there's differences of opinion. There's not all one consensus of everything. So I get a little nervous when people are obsessed with the chronology of the Quran to be honest because I don't know where this is coming from. I'm happy with what the prophet did for us and left for us. I'm I think we have a good a good thing going. Alhamdulillah. I don't think we need to reorder it. There are in some of the more expansive encyclopedic taps, you will find people that will talk about um you know when some things were revealed, but keep in mind that there's no consensus. Many of these many of the suras themselves the have differences of opinion. Is this a Meccan surah or a Medan surah? Or maybe it happened at the end of the Meccan period, the beginning of the Medina period. There are differences of opinion. Yeah. And so imi is doing the the uh sorry the class in chronology on Sunday with with a story. So further the details will be with imi inshallah. How did we get to this? You know that Gabriel reviewed the Quran with the prophetam every Ramadan and then as the years went on Gabriel will tell the prophet sallallaihi wasallam you know recite the fat so he knows okay the fat is first okay recite bakar and he would recite soak second recite oh this is third so the order what we what we call is called meaning the order is established through revelation by Gabriel to the prophetam the prophet then taught it to the Sahabah who codified the Quran, wrote it, memorized it, so on and so forth. So there's no there's no human uh agency in establishing the order of the Quran. This was established through revelation and that's how it was established at the time of the prophet then codified in the mus of Abu Bakr and then in the mus of the next question probably from the same person is about the names of the suras. So this is a little bit different. Sometimes the prophet most of the times he would tell the companions you know this is surah so and so this is surah so and so but many of the suras have multiple names like fata there's at least six seven names of al fat so there is no unifi I can't say that this is the only of the 114 suras this is just just the names because you will find mah in other parts of the Muslim world that sometimes the the surah is called like surah is also called surah ben So if you find a Quran and it says, don't think that there's a mistake. It's just that's also from the either it's a major theme in the that surah or a major story uh or there's a tradition associated with the name. But usually I would say the majority of them there is a tradition attributed to the prophet in which he mentioned the name of the surah and then the most you know popular of those traditions is how we end up getting the names that we have in the Quran. Okay, next question. Somebody who says in their workplace there's no running water in the restroom, uh just the toilet seat. Can you use tissue paper to purify yourself after ur urinating and defecating and then pray afterwards while still at work? Well, first of all, you need to make woodoo to pray. So, I it's hard for me to understand that there's a bathroom in this country that doesn't have any running water at all. That I don't understand. But let me answer the first part. Can you clean yourself from the bathroom using toilet paper and not water? Yes, it's a you can use a hard substance or you can use water. Water is better if you if you or you could use both. And if you don't have both and you only have one or not the other, you can use one or not the other. That's those are both permissible ways that the prophet taught us how to clean ourselves after the bathroom. As far as praying, you need to make woodoo because you would be in a situation or in a place where there's usually running water. So you would have to make woodoo. If you can't make woodoo for whatever reason that there's no water, I would suggest delaying your prayer until you come home and combining it. If the time works, if it's a very dire situation, there's no water and then there's no time, then you have to do yourum and you have to pray. Okay. The next question is about userie ribba. Of course, there has to be a ribba question. And um you know indicating that the person that engages in ribba, Allahh declares war against the person and the prophet obviously it's a major sin. May Allah tala protect us. How can you make tabba from the ribba? But then the example that the questioner gives is they buy a house uh you know a loan from a house. So buying a house with a with a conventional mortgage is not a ribeye transaction. That's permissible. So inshallah that's fine and there's nothing to make from in regards to that. But let's say that somebody actually did engage in a ribeye transaction. Then you makea you ask Allah for forgiveness and you try your best not to do that again as you would with any sin. But the conventional way of going to a to financing a home any finance of an item a home a car furniture whatever the case may be in the modern we call this finance we don't call it we don't call it a loan so the financing of an asset as long as between you and the financial transa transaction is that asset then the transaction is considered halal inshallah many of us work in political jobs whether in the White House or Congress or State Department etc. What are the most important FK rulings to know about working in such jobs? I mean that's kind of open-ended but I would say that um you know these are what we call public service jobs in which you are providing a public service and it's important to remember the the the the major principles behind whatever agency you're in and understanding why that agency was established and uh the partition of of political powers that defines our republican system of government. These are the things that most people don't care about anymore and don't talk about anymore. And that's really important because that's actually what it means to be an American. Um, so we should remember that and if you're in that job and you're doing it, you should remember why that was set up and understand what the relevant sections in the Constitution are about this. You know, if if it's if the Constitution addresses what you're in. The other thing is to be ethical in your job and and to be honest and to not lie and steal. The same thing I would say to anybody. We have an obligation to work honestly and to make an honest living and inshallah there is great reward in uh you know public service positions. So not to belittle that this is a great you know a thing of honor and and we have a a rich tradition of that the prophet sallallaihi wasallam had many jobs that he had dispensed to the Sahabah that would we what we would call today government jobs. you know, people that were ambassadors and translators and people that were scribes that wrote letters and people that he ordered different companions to learn other languages so that they could translate Syriak and Hebrew and Latin. Uh there were Sahaba that could do that. Uh and there were Sahaba that were experts in other religions. So they would in they would they were the prophetam's expert, you know, consultant on those that those that's the language we would use today. But the prophet would rely on them to for them to inform him about something that was in the Torah or something that the Romans said or something that the Persians said so on and so forth. So there's a whole thing called the government of the prophet. It's a genre of writing in the if you get those books you will see all of the there are hundreds of positions that the prophet sallallam had and the early Sahabah had that formed what we would call Islamic governance and statecraftraft. So this is very much part of our tradition and there's it's a great thing. So if you are find yourself in one of these positions, you should try to make those links as well and see those different Sahaba that served in those different type of positions, how they carried themselves and and how they functioned. Of course, I'm speaking ideally. I I mean I'm sure there might be specifics that I'm not aware of that we can talk about in another opportunity. Okay, next question. Are stock options permissible? Yes, because stocks a type of investment in the company. We considered trade goods. So stocks, stock options, uh you get hired and you get stock options and they vest over a certain you know time period. All of that's permissible inshallah. Under the next question, under the fatwa on the permissibility of corrupt contracts in non-Muslim countries, does that permit buying stocks in USA companies which deal in the impermissible? For example, buying stocks in a supermarket which may also sell alcohol or buying stock in a bank which may be engaged in impermissible transactions. I mean yes and no. the the the the opinion of the of the is that you can engage in that has something that is corrupt in it but does not invalidate the transactions because in the med there are two legal distinctions that are not shared on the other. So can you buy and sell alcohol in general? The hanafi would said yes you can buy it but that's there's a corrupt aspect which you're buying something which is neg for example you can't buy and sell alcohol would not it would be considered void or you couldn't buy and sell like a dog or something like that because it's considered so based on this distinction there's a there's a huge you know gap in or there's a huge opportunity in the in the med for when it comes to Muslim minorities. So that means that you could uh you could be a shop owner and sell alcohol and sell per pork products in this country even if you're a Muslim. But that doesn't mean that anything that you invest in or anything that you engage in is permissible. So you couldn't, you know, invest in a company that's, you know, selling drones to kill innocent people or something like that's just all out haram. That's not what that that fat is talking about. So when you say a bank that's engaging in impermissible transactions, it depends what those transactions are. Most of the conventional banks transactions are permissible. They're not impermissible to start out with. So a con like Bank of America or you know City Bank or something like that, those type of banks would be permissible to invest in inshallah. Okay, next question. If your mother tells you not to talk to your cousin and if you talk to your cousin she will get extremely angry. Then what do you do? You know obey your mom for two or three days and then send a message to your cousin because you know you have to keep your family ties but you have to obey your mother. So you can interpret your mother saying don't speak to your cousin meaning right now but after a day or two then that expires and that's how we solve a lot of these problems. Uh, but don't do it to upset your mother. I mean, if you know that it's if you're doing it with the intention that you're going to upset your mother, then you've gone the wrong direction. That's a big problem. And let me tell you, if your parents are upset with you, you're you're screwed in this world and in the next. So, don't ever upset your parents on purpose. Always try to uh make your parents pleased with you. And parents, don't abuse that and use that as a uh, you know, a power play over your children. But, you know, when it comes to our parents, all bets are off. So we should do everything possible to obey our parents and make them happy. But when it comes to something like this, you sess there has to be some you have to be savvy with the issue. Uh find out what's wrong. You know, you want to connect with your cousin. Maybe your mom has a a reason that you're not aware of. You can talk about it. But my immediate re answer is obey your mother, you know, this week and then maybe next week you can send your cousin a message and like, hey, you know, just making sure you're okay, but I, you know, it's not a good time for me to talk. Something like that. Okay. Next question. Recently I received a pay raise. Alhamdulillah. And managed to save money. Now I have some thousands of dollars saved and I think I should pay zak on this money. I never paid zaka before. So can you explain how it's calculated? Okay. So to pay zaka there are a few things that we need to have. The first thing the first box is we have to have what we call the minimal zakatable amount. It's called anisab. What is anisab? And nisab is the for us here in America the dollar amount of 83 grams of 21 karat gold. Where does that come from? It comes from that the gold that was in the pocket of the prophet the gold dinars that they used at the time of the Sahabah was 21 karat and 83 grams that comes from the hadith. I did the calculation before I came and I was shocked because it's doubled what it was a year ago. the the nisab today on September what's today September the 16th is 10,085 10 let's say $10,86 and I have a little notebook where I write these things because I'm always asked these questions and I looked at like a year or two years ago it was half of that so that's the so that means if you have less than $10,086 then there's no zak at all for you don't you just you just wait until you've reached that limit let's say you have $15,000. Okay, so you've checked the first box. I have The second box that you have to tick is that you have to have complete ownership. So that's in my account or maybe I'm old school and I withdrew it from the bank and I put it in a plastic bag in the backyard or I put it under the mattress or something like that or in the in the cabinet like our grandparents. Allah have mercy on them. You have to be able to meaning you can do with it what you want. And then the third thing is that one lunar year has have had to pass and that money at that amount or more is in your complete possession. After that, then you're going to pay 2.5% on that zakat. So let's say I get $15,000 today. I'm so happy I go to the mall next month and I buy myself something very expensive. Okay? I I didn't have the money for more than a year. So there's no zakat implications. I have the money and I put it in a savings account and I forget about it and then the year passes I'm going to pay 2.5% on it. I have $15,000 and I feel you know what because brother Tar answered this question I'm going to give half of it to ICCP. Alhamdulillah. So you give half of it so you now you have 7,000 a little change. Now you're below the there's no zak so on and so forth. Okay. So those are the three things. Number one is you have to have the minimal zakatable amount. 85 gram of 21 karat gold which in today's number is about 10,85 to 86 complete ownership and a year has passed excuse me only on savings not on income. So it doesn't matter the source of the money. But the point is is that you've have the minimal amount in in your account or more for more than a year. No, not on a monthly basis because it has to hold for a year. So let's say I make $50,000 a year. Uh $50,000 a month. That's above but my monthly expenses are 40,000 or 45,000. So that means I only have really $5,000. So I'm not in the in that situation. Okay, next question. This is from Imam Rafi. I can say that because it's imaf. Is the prophet alive in his grave? And what does that mean? The prophet sallallaihi wasallam and all of the mia are alive in their graves by consensus of the entire ummah of s Muhammad. There is no no dispute because he himself is the one that told us this that the Allah tala has forbidden the earth from decomposing and eating the bodies of the m and the prophet when he was in the isra in the maj he said when I was in Jerusalem I saw Moses praying in his grave by the red s sand dune and a and if you were with me I would have shown him to you. So this is a point of consensus. They're all sound hadith im one of the great muhadis of the of the you know the later generation. Well he's still from the but the end of the period. He has a whole book called you know the the lives of the prophets all of them prophets plural in their graves. Why is this important? Because some people think that the prophet died and we don't say that the prophet died. We say he moved to Why do we say that? Well, out of respect for the prophet and to remind ourselves that he and all of the MBA are alive in their graves. They're alive in their graves. And the prophet returns our salam when we give salam. Comes from the sound hadith. The prophet sallallaihi wasallam when he receives our actions every week also comes from a sound hadith. If there's good, he thanks Allah. If there's bad, he intercedes on our behalf. Allah subh tells us in the Quran if they wrong themselves and they come to you. Yeah. Muhammad in the Quran they come to you. They come to you in during your life and then they come to you after your life because this is a a verse of it's a verse that is giving us a piece of information. There's no abrogation in information. There's only abrogation in in Sharia rulings. So this verse therefore is valid in the prophet's life and valid at the end for all time. And then in the prayer we say we are that's we say that you are addressing the prophet in the all of these things remind us that the prophetam is alive in his grave and we have a let's say a spiritual relationship with the prophetatam. Now some people that are material they think death is it the person has died and it's over. No death is not that he said people are asleep and when they die they wake up. So as a believer we are reminded that there is life in this world and then there's life in the hereafter. And the reason um one of the reasons that we remind ourselves of this is when somebody dies what do we do? We don't just throw the body away. We wash the body. We shroud the body. We pray over the body. We gently bury the body. We do the at the grave. We Why do we do all of this? Because the person's alive a different type of life. This is just a different type of life. All of us will experience that. So yes, the prophet this is a point of you know this is what we say you know this is a very basic principle that all Muslims of all sects of all times of all geographies agree to as part of our tradition that all of the Mia are alive in the graves of nu the yeah that's a very good point you know Allah tells us don't say about the people that die in the way of Allah that they are dead. They are with Allah subhana wa tala. Uh they are being given sustenance. That's another you know another good point. Okay. Next question. My brother told us he is gay and wants us to meet his partner. Should we agree to this? Should he continue to meet our kids? He has not told my parents yet and he is scared to do it but was thinking of it. What do we do now? It's very hard to answer these types of questions in this type of forum because you know all of these things are going to be contingent with the with the actual circumstance. I mean I don't know who the person is at all but you know what I would say is this is an issue in which you have to differentiate between the sin and the sinner. Uh we don't we don't accept homosexuality the act or homosexual marriage or you know it's not like we're going to integrate this into our community. There's no room for that because it's something that is forbidden primmaaccia from the text of the Quran and the text of the hadith. So from that point of view, there's no coexisting with that. Nor do we have to coexist with that. It's just not compatible with our tradition in our way. So nothing will ever change that ever for any sect of Islam for any time or any geog. It's just it's like what the the previous question about are the prophets alive in their graves? It's it's by the text of the Quran and the text of the hadith. nothing is ever going to change that belief. So from that point of view, you know, we're not going to accept it. And you have to make sure that you're not put you don't put yourself in a position where you're like, okay, I have to accept it. No, you don't have to accept it because it's not compatible with our beliefs. That's the sin. But then there's the case of the sinner. There's the person. Can the person a person be a sinner and be a believer? Of course. That's our way as Sunni Muslims. It was the that said if you commit a sin then you remove yourself from Islam. That is not our way. And the prophet criticized the people of the and he said he said that the are the dogs of hellfire. So that's not our way. We do not remove anybody from Islam because they commit a sin but rather we want to encompass people as much as we can. There's a very beautiful hadith which the prophet sallallaihi wasallam he said this is a hadith. Whoever has amorous, passionate love for somebody. He didn't say who. He's for somebody. That's what is and they act accord they they protect that. They don't they don't misact on that feeling and they suppress and they hide that feeling. and that person dies. They die as a shahed. So the prophet indicated for us that we could find ourselves in a situation in which we have a love or an amorous love that we cannot act on like if a man falls in love with a married woman or vice versa or if a man falls in love with a man and a woman falls in love with a with a woman which is more in line with the case. In other words, the feelings that one has does not mean that we have to act on that feeling. That's another thing that when it comes to homosexuality in our community, we really don't make that distinction clear enough. You might have feelings uh but not every feeling that you have can be a halal feeling if you act on it. And sometimes you have to work and and fight and suppress that feeling. Just like if I fell in love with another woman and she's married, well, I can't there's no halal. There's nothing I can do with that except I better do what the prophet said be quiet about it and suppress it and then inshallah that that act of denying myself will take me to the paradise it will act I'll be a shahid that's what the prophet is saying so when it comes to the sinner in the question we want to be able to see how we can help or how we can uh intervene or how we can keep them within the faith so on and so forth keeping in mind that that does not equate to okay Now we have to accept it and now there's like the you know LGBT section in our mo it's not going to happen because we don't h we don't allow that our religion does not allow that our mosque follows the Sharia of Satan Muhammad sallallam and when we come into the mosque we all have to do the same thing we have to dress a certain way stand a certain way pray a certain way that's how it is in this in this space that we have so that's something to think about excuse me what about Okay. A family member that doesn't believe anymore. What do you mean by doesn't believe? Like they just don't they don't pray or they're like, "I'm not a Muslim anymore. What does this mean?" Well, people are people. So, no. If you have a family member, you have to have a I mean the the the Sahaba's families were were not just mushiks but they were fighting the prophet and he still had relationships. I mean you have to have relationship with your family irrespective of their belief or lack of belief or their sin or their crime or this or that. Family is family and your parents or your parents whether they believe or they don't believe you still have to have a good relationship with your family. So from the point of view of um if if I have a family member that left Islam or something like that, I'm still, you know, going to have to connect and try to connect and again the sin and the sinner to differentiate between the two and to be a a positive force in their life. A lot of times people leave for all sorts of reason. They were abused. They think something wrong about Islam and that wrong belief took them away from Islam. Those people are not to blame. we are to blame that we didn't hug them and embrace them and bring them into our community. So if somebody has a wrong idea about Islam and rejects that wrong idea, they haven't left Islam. They've re they've left something that me and you would leave too because that's not what Islam is. So I'm very cautious to to call people, oh somebody left Islam. I really don't know what what is the Islam that they had that they left because the Islam that we know is this beautiful, tolerant, peaceful, easygoing thing. So you left that. I mean for what then? So obvious usually when I interact with such people they didn't really leave Islam as we understand it but they left some notion or some abuse or some bad scenario. Somebody goes to Quran school and they're sexually abused by the sheh. I mean you would leave too. I mean that she needs to be in jail. It's not a sheh it's a charlatan. So that's not somebody that's left Islam in my book. That's just somebody who had a traumatic experience and naturally they moved away from that trauma. So that's something to keep in mind. Okay, the last question on my list. Actually, I made it through most of them, all of them. Um, a question about the how short the could be. One person observed that sometimes our imams do make it short. I have a feeling that's that's directed towards me [Laughter] because I'm usually on the short side. Could you expand on this, please? Okay. The is what we say in the second raqa of a uh of a four raqa prayer or or and what we say in the last raqa when we sit down etc until the now to make things more confusing uh the are of different opinions about the obligation or lack of obligation of saying the so I'm not going to touch that but I just wanted to highlight that it is a difference of opinion but for those like the and the say it's an obligation what is the minimum that you can say or that you have to say it's the part I wrote it down this is like the smallest version and then the that's it and then the last one the last if it's like the prayer or the last raka of the other prayers you would add after that Allah Muhammad that's it that would be the minimal amount so you could see I mean I'm not saying you should do the minimal like when I teach my kids the minimal wudoo they're like that's all you have to do I was like yeah but I'm not telling you to do that but I want you to know that's how you build your your understanding I'm not saying you should do this but that's how short it could be um the imams are in different speeds that's just bad habit from us maybe because we're used to saying it and we say it fast. Uh it's like oh I was just going to say it's like for example in in okay the first two raqas are out loud so you're saying it out loud but then the last two raqas you're saying it quietly and if you notice the last two rakas are are like a fraction of the time of the first two rakas. It's because you're saying it so fast to yourself, the imam, that you just, you know, it's just bad time management from us my what I got the message. I got the message. I got that's why I don't like to lead the prayer. So I know that even though I'm I know it's it's mostly imis and these questions, I only lead a prayer on occasion. Yeah. So I think it's it's not about that we're saying something different. I think it's just we we're just saying it too fast. Yeah. And this is a sunnah that I picked up from my who always recited and there's a there's a hadith about that. So that's the thing about the it can be short uh and um when it comes to us leading the prayer we have to do a better job at slowing down especially in the silent prayers and then the to give people behind us enough time it's just bad habit really that's okay these are the questions that I had um let me see if there's anything else I hope that uh I answered them to everyone's satisfaction okay let me see If someone is struggling with clinical depression to the point where even simple daily tasks such as eating or caring for themselves feel overwhelming, is it permissible for them to perform with a rock or clean earth instead of woodoo so that they can still hold their prayers with greater ease? There's no um there's not enough direct relationship between depression and woodoo. Um if somebody was OCD uh and had some type of issue on that and I've dealt with that before, especially with woodoo, I would say yes, just do and and that would solve the problem. But somebody that's depressed um uh as a default my answer would be like no you should make woodoo. But if the depression is such that the person like can't get out of bed and can't move and then you would say the person is sick and you can make when you're sick. So sometimes when we respond like that people think it's insensitive. I'm not saying that I'm not belittling the person that has depression but I'm saying there's a category in called I'm sick and I can't use the water. So, I'm going to make So, this is where the person falls. That's all I'm saying. Not trying to belittle somebody's, you know, mental issues. But, um, in other words, if I'm sick and I have a cold, you know, one of you have a cold or a flu, God forbid, and you just can't get up to go to the bathroom, the water will make you more sick. You just you can't do it. And you have to pray lying down or sitting down. That's a person that's going to make. So, if the person is like that, they just can't get up. Yes, they could make. But I'm hesitant to say that fully because I feel that it it would be we should encourage the person to go to use the water to cleanse themselves and to make to make a proper woodoo inshallah. That's it. Is there anybody has a question? Alhamdulillah. Okay. Sorry too. >> Okay. Okay. Could you tell us what is baraka in everyday life and mention some acts to increase baraka? You know baraka is you know divine grace uh that one's time is filled with abundance and one's state is filled with abundance and one's relationship is filled with abundance just like when our mother took the prophet sallallaihi wasallam when he was an infant and um no one wanted to take him because he was an orphan or he didn't have a father I mean and they thought well He doesn't have a father. No one's going to pay us. So, Haleima took him. And the minute she took him, everything was an increase. Her milk was an increase. The animals were increased. The kids stopped crying. And then the next morning, her husband said, "Didn't you notice the baraka, the extra baraka that we had?" He said, "This probably this child sallallahu alaihi wasallam." That's what baraka is. Is there's just an abundance. It doesn't necessarily mean that there's actual physical increase, but this everything starts working and everything is, you know, firing on all cylinders. And the way that we bring in the baraka is when we connect ourselves with that which is absolute. We connect ourselves with Allah and his prophetat. That's how we bring the baraka. Doing the salawat on the prophet brings the baraka. Making of Allah subhah brings the baraka. Waking up in the morning the prophet the baraka is in the early morning. That's why I said sleep early, early early to bed, early to rise. That's where there's the baraka. So following the guidance of the prophet, that's how you're going to increase the baraka. Baraka is when you eat, the prophet like to eat a meal in which many hands were involved. So his eating was communal. We all eat by ourselves or like in the car or like on the rush. The prophet he wouldn't eat unless it was like a big thing like there has to be several people eating in the same dish and that's and if you eat if you have those type of meals those type of meals have a lot of baraka much more than you know when you eat at home by yourself so following those things is how we increase the baraka being together sharing meals together early to rise doing our calling on Allah calling on the prophetam that's how we fill our time with the baraka inshallah Oh, then this will be the last one. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay. Uh, we know that if a dog licks a bowl, it must be washed seven times with the first washing done with soil. My question is, what if a person lives with someone who puts the bowl that a dog has drunk from into the dishwasher together with the other dishes? Does the bowl still need to be washed again seven times with the first wash using soil or does the dishwasher suffice for purification of the dishwashers is enough then after it has been washed there as soon as the washer once so well don't put the soil in the dishwasher is what I was saying um so of course there's a difference of opinion so in this case it sounds like you live with a person or you live with a dog and in that case you're going to have to just take Immatic's position because if you didn't take Imam Matic's position saying that the dog is pure then that does not suffice. You would have to actually wash it seven separate times. One of them with dirt. So you'd have to take it out of the dishwasher, put some dirt around it and then wash it I guess five more times. So and that becomes too cumbersome. So in this case just follow Imam Maddx's position that the dog is not ne and that's fine. If you have a dog in your home, my only advice is to keep one space or one room where the the dog doesn't enter and that's the room where you pray because of the hadith that the angels don't come and occupy the same space as a dog. >> Last last last question. >> This is the last one. Yeah. >> If a Hindu gives you food from one of their services they do to praise their idols and they share it with you, are we allowed to eat it? Muhammad, no. Of course not. It's one of my students. If something is used for the um as an offering or as a sacrifice that we cannot eat it. We can only eat that which Allah's name was was but if it was like a gathering and it was just like refreshments and it wasn't actually participated in the in the religious act that would be fine. So you have to make a distinction. Speech. Speech. Speech.
