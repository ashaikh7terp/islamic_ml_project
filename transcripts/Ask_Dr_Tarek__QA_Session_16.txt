we have another open question and answer session and today we have 21 questions even though some of them i believe are repeats however quite a few of them are uh what's the right word hefty so the first few questions will probably take up the majority of the time and then there are some rapid fire questions towards the end so without any further ado and without any specific order will begin inshaallah so the first question and i'll read the question the way i receive it i personally try to follow imam abu hanifa's rules my question is about sadaqah what is sadaqah what are the rules of sadaqah who is eligible for that the person who is getting it should they know that this is sadaqa money or meat or other such things and can we just give money or can we sacrifice goat sheep or any halal animal and give the meat to the poor or can we give any household things or clothings in sadaqah with the hadith please please help me out this matter because nowadays in the pandemic every muslim family is doing it okay so this question is is very large and i believe the questioner is asking about zakah so first let's talk about zakah and then we can talk about sadaqah which is charity so the first thing is that there's a distinction between zakah and sadhaka zakay is an act of worship it is something that allah has legislated upon us upon excess wealth excess crops excess livestock trade goods and there's also zakatul the zakat that we owe during the month of ramadan so let us talk about zakar the people of zakar some of the rules of zakah before we talk about zakat al-fitr and then we will talk about the udhaya which takes place in because the questioner is asking about that allah that there are eight categories of people that receive zakah so allah says so there is excess money there is excess gold and silver there is excess crops there is excess livestock there is trade goods somebody who trades meaning that they buy something and then they sell the same thing not a manufacturer manufacturer a sana there's no zakat on that at tijara is that you buy apples and you sell apples you buy coffee green raw coffee you sell your trader for the trade goods tijara these are the areas in which there is zakah and of course we're not going to discuss all of the rules but there has to be certain conditions that you have to have full ownership that has to reach the nisab which is a certain value amount in each of those categories one whole lunar year has had to pass if all of those conditions are fulfilled then you are going to take the 2.5 percent of that excess and you are going to give it to in zakah to be distributed to one of these eight categories so the poor and the needy the poor and the needy are the first two categories the poor person is defined as somebody who for example they need a hundred every month but they only have 80. so they're they're short a little bit the needy and mesquite is less than that they need a hundred each month but they only have 20. and then imam malik his definition was reversed he understood the definition of the poor to be the definition of the needy and the definition of the needy to be the poor but that's there's no reason to get into that distinction so the poor in the needle those who distribute the zakah are also from the people that can receive the zakah so if there's an intricate distribution network of people that distribute the zakam because of course you have to understand if you're paying zakam on these categories everybody's zakah calendar is different so there's not one time in the year in which everybody receives or everyone gives their zakah so that's why the baitul mel or the or the treasury of the muslims is something that is a full-time job so and those whose hearts are to be reconciled these are people who have newly become muslim or people who have some stature amongst their people uh and that the government the muslim government determines or the mufti or the khadi determines that by giving them some of the zakah money we might be able to help the islam be more firmly rooted in those people or more of those people will become muslim etc those who are in bondage we don't have slavery anymore but that is one of the categories that the zakah money can be taken to free those who are enslaved those are who in debt is those who fight a valid jihad for the cause of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala traditionally understood to be preparing an army that is fighting fisabililla and there's some difference of opinions amongst the salaf if fighting can be done in other than you know with weapons and it can be fighting by the tongue etc there's a difference of an opinion weapon is sebil and those who are traveling who are away from their homes and they've been cut off from their home and they've been cut off from the resources and they can't get home these are the eight categories those are the people who receive this zakah whether it be money whether it be crops whether it be livestock etc so bait and man the the concept of the the islamic treasury is something that is much more than simply money it's something that in which there was you know there should be livestock and there should be storage for grains and and things like that it's something that is is diverse and then those that will distribute try to give to as many categories as possible as many of these eight categories as possible so that it can be evenly spread out again so this is the zakah these are the people who are supposed to receive the zakah now a question comes do i have to give the zakker from these if i have a livestock do i have to give the livestock itself or can i pay the value of the livestock that i have to pay because this is the issue that will come up later with the difference of opinion with the focus some people say yes some people say no but usually typically you take from that which nefsel jins from that same issue the same thing that you are paying the zakat on usually you take from that and you put it into the zakah for the zakah box for distribution okay so this is zakah on the things that we possess normally there are other types of zakah or there's only one other type of zakah which is a catholic the catholic is something that we owe every single person whether they be rich or whether they be poor in the month of ramadan before salat it is one sa asa is one of the islamic measurements which is about two and a half kilograms of of grain one saw of the food that's a staple food of this area so could be rice it could be grain it could be beans it could be raisins it could be dates different areas have different staple foods and that's why the price the the monetary value of that saw for zaquetto fitz will be different because uh a kilogram of rice is different than a kilogram of wheat it's different than a kilogram of dates different than a kilogram of raisins so on and so forth so in our message for example we approximate how much it is you know we take the average cost and we determine that now the traditional fic is distributed in that those grains itself so let's say for example the staple food for us is dates like we live in medina and it's dates so zacchaeus literally you're going to take the saw of dates and you're going to pass out you know this package dates to people this was at the time of the prophet saws the time of the salaf the time of the sahaba etc a question emerges later can we give the monetary value of that saw of grains or does it have to be the grains itself the answer is yes you can give the value of the money why by the value of the grains why because the reason behind zakatul fitz when you analyze the hadith first of all there are multiple hadith in all different collections in which the amount of grain mentioned by the prophet sasan or the sahaba is different for different grains it's not just i said it's a saw that's the traditional fil but when you analyze the the proof text the dalin the hadith you find that sometimes it's assa sometimes it's half assad the ulama understood from that that the reason the what is called in law the ratio legis the reason behind the law is not that the grain itself be given to the needy person but that the value be given to the needy person at that time the value was in the grain people in medina at that time or in mecca they don't they don't want gold coins and silver coins the dinar and the did him they want actual food but now maybe the people that are needy don't want the grains where they're going to do the bag of wheat they want money so they can buy the things that they need so allah might say yes it is permissible to give the value of that saw of that two and a half kilograms of grain how do we determine that we look at the average of the different staple foods and grains that are mentioned in the hadith like i mentioned and we take an average and that's why every year in the beginning of ramadan we sort of say it's it's around 12 it's around 15 etc it could be higher it could be 30 per person or it could be lower it could be seven eight dollars if you go on the lower side but the the the the prophet said make the poor people enrich them so they don't have to go around begging on the day of so the point of the zakatul fit is that you give happiness to the people and that people are you know they receive this and so we want to be a little bit more generous okay so this is the catholic the story of the catholic and the issue the legal issue of can you give it in money in a dollar amount or currency amount or do you have to give it only in grains and then the questioner asks about the udhaya about the sacrificing that we do in the difference of opinion between them whether the is obligatory or whether it's a sunnah for imam it's obligatory for imam it's a sunnah so it's not something that all of the agree on and when there's a difference of opinion we are allowed to follow the opinion that is most compatible with our situation what is to be sacrificed to do the we can sacrifice a goat you can sacrifice a sheep you can sacrifice a cow you can sacrifice a camel these are the categories of the animals for the odhea so if you want to fulfill whether you interpret it as a sunnah or whether you interpret as an obligation you sacrifice one of these animals and for beginning from the day of the ninth of the hijjah to the last day of the hajj in that time period and then you distribute the mean to those who are poor if you do that check the box i have done say i don't do that then we will follow the opinion of imam shafi who says it's only a sunnah sunnah of course but it's not afar so there's no ism there's no sin involved but i want to give money to those who are in need as charity fine you've done something else that is good but you have not fulfilled this sunnah on the checklist of acts of worship where it says the line that says you have not done that you have done something else which is you have given money to those who are poor is there anything i left out okay i think those are the issues related to the zakah we talked about the zakah zakar on money they count gold and silver zakar on livestock the care on crops zakar on trade goods that's the normal zakah and then there's zakat unfit we talked about that and then there's the oda that takes place in and we talked about the categories of the people that receive it sadaqa so this is zakah what is sadaqah sadaka is simply charity there are no rules for charity charity is blind you give the charity whatever you give you give whether you smile in somebody's face because the prophet saws said smiling in someone's face is a sadaqa or whether you give somebody something you have old clothes or you have they need food or they need help you offer them a service or you give them money all of that is sadaqa all of that is charity and the prophet sallallahu alaihi said whoever can help their brother or sister then let them help them so anything you can do to assist your brother and sister in islam is a form of charity removing the harmful object from the street is a form of charity so on and so forth so charity is something that is very wide it's unrestricted it can be very little it can be very big everything that we've discussed up until now is zakah which is something that is legislated by the sharia because it's an act of worship i believe there were some questions how do we calculate our zakay that this is another time because this is uh we will require will take us down another path we can talk about that we can have a whole thing on zakker okay that was question number one by the way question number two how does one rationalize an infinite hellfire for humans no matter how bad who committed finite sins in a finite time that is supposed to comparably be the link of an eye blink of an eye and are the sins we will commit written in our book that is known when we are in our stage of fitra there are four or five questions that are are of the same nature about health fire and about uh free uh free will or predetermination etc so to understand the series of questions and how to begin to make sense of them and to understand them you have to understand a couple of things number one allah is the creator allah subhanahu ta'ala has created everything that possibly is is allah's creation and nothing was with him so there is nothing that we perceive nothing that we see except that allah created it and therefore everything in the universe that is created including us are allah's creation and nothing happens in this universe except that allah subhanahu ta'ala wills it and allows it to happen so if i have in my if i own something and i have a little space in my house where i keep these things i'm collecting i don't know figurines or something like that i own them they're mine and i take pleasure in them and i like them and then one day i say you know what i don't like this anymore and i want to take them and i want to donate them or i want to take them and i want to throw them away i'm free to do with my possessions what i will because they're mine is the greater example so whatever allah wants will happen whatever allah wills will happen and whatever allah does not will does not happen so we have to not just understand that but we have to believe that because that will help us understand these type of questions so how do we rationalize the hellfire that allah created heaven and hell and allah created people for heaven and he created people for help everybody has been given the capacity to do that which allah has decreed for them to do the people that will enter into the hell fire will enter into the hell fire by allah subhanahu ta'ala's justice allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has given them a message allah has warned them allah has given them opportunity and they have turned their backs on that message if you don't if somebody does not fall in that category they will not be placed in the hellfire because allah says we will not punish a people unless and until we send them a message so if somebody has been given a message taught what's right from wrong given opportunity to do right and has chosen to to step away from that and to disobey allah that it is through allah's justice that they will enter into the hell hellfire but at the same time if allah wills allah can forgive and we believe that allah is rahim and therefore if allah decides to forgive a people or allah has bestowed faith on a person and they have entered into allah's paradise they have entered into allah's paradise through his mercy through his rahmah so for us to understand heaven and hell we must understand and our place in this creation this does not mean that we do not have free will however because allah subhanahu wa therefore there would be no justice if allah makes us do certain things then there would be no point of heaven and hell because we're sort of robotic so allah does not make us do a or b but allah gives us the capacity to do a or b like i'm sitting here speaking to you allah is giving me the ability to do this and had allah not willed that i sit here now and do this i would not be able to do this no matter what i want i am not six foot eight i cannot slam dunk no matter how much i want to be a professional nba player it will never ever ever happen because allah has not given me the capacity to do that so if i want to come and grab this glass of water and bring it here as a sunni muslim i say allah has given me this ability and i have acquired this ability to be able to do that and that is the meaning of allah's creative word be and it is but allah is not telling me or not forcing me to grab that glass i have chosen to grab that glass of water and therefore i am morally responsible for my actions if i do good then i have i deserve or i earn rather a reward if i do something bad what i do then i earn a sin okay so this is how we reconcile our belief with allah's the creator but nothing happens except allah wills it etc and at the same time i am free to choose these things the next question i heard that in the barzah alike souls will be drawn to each other those inclined to good and those inclined to evil is that true yes the souls like in this dunya you meet people that you like and you meet people that you can't stand even though they've done nothing wrong to you so the souls can attract one another or they repel one another if so how can one rationalize free will with such inclinations written in our souls before we start our lives on earth because allah knows what we will do because allah is not bound by time so allah knows how my life will end but i am the one that is choosing these decisions that i make but allah is not bound by time because time is one of the dimensions of the created world just like space is like weight is there are in the study of islamic logic that we take from aristotelian logic there are ten we call them ten categories there are ten things that define an object and the ulema they put it in this this funny line of poetry they said um there's two lines of funny poetry it says that there's this there's a man named zaid he's blue and he is the son of malik he was in his house yesterday reclining in his hand was a stick he bent it so it bent these are the ten categories so zade is an object he's blue it's his color he's the son of malek it's a nisba it's a type of relationship he was in his house it's a location yesterday time he was leaning position in his hand was a stick possession he bent it action it bent reaction all of those things apply to our world but they do not apply to allah ta'ala allah does not have time does not have place does not have space etc etc etc so the idea of free will and our inclinations etc allah in his knowledge in the subhanallah knows what we will do but allah is not forcing us to do as we said in the previous question if abu jahl was inclined to anger as a natural predestin predisposition how does that factor into his actions on this earth it they factor into his actions because the prophet sasam was in front of him and he was given the opportunity to believe and he chose not to believe it was as simple as that and he has no excuse in not believing because the the messenger sallallahu sanam was there in front of him and not just that he was his nephew he was on relative next question if allah's mercy is as i imagine it to be how do i reckon that with making sure i really legitimately have fear for the hellfire any time i try to envision the reality i think of allah's mercy and it stops the thought there there are different levels of worship the lowest level of worship is to be fearful of the hellfire and to be covetous of the paradise but a higher level of worship is to be concerned with allah himself and not to be concerned with heaven or hell so you're this is a gift that allah has given you your con you are so focused on allah's mercy that all you're focusing on is allah's love and mercy towards you and towards creation so you're not even thinking of the hell fire okay that's good that's a higher level of worship it's a higher level of faith you know the carrot and the stick what do they say you catch more bees with honey right there's some truth to that some people need hard love some people need fire and brimstone but most people especially in our day and age that does not work with them if the masjid was full of the hellfire and the punishment of the grave and this and that no one would come right no who wants to listen to that message i mean it's so just look at the news every day it's so depressing when you feel like the world is coming apart right so this is a space that we want to create where we are happy and we are you know we reconnect with deep belief so how is your relationship with allah are you worshiping allah because you fear him or are you worshiping allah because you want something from him or are you worshiping allah subhanahu ta'ala because you love him it's different like a child who fears their parent or a child who's good to their parent because they want something for their parent or a child who loves their parents because they are their parents there are three different modes same thing with our relationship with allah subhanahu ta'ala so if you're full of the happiness of allah's mercy and you can't contemplate allah punishing someone that's good because this is the reality because allah subhanahu wa is in no need of punishing anyone and if allah wants to forgive us all he can forgive us all in sha allah okay next question similarly i believe this is all from the same person similarly if i make dua do i believe 100 percent that it will be given to me in that form or something better even for the things that i may potentially not be worthy of like being said having the shade of allah's throne gentle etc can i freely believe that if i sincerely ask for it that i can walk this earth truly believing that allah will give it to me or something better one hundred percent the prophet sallallahu alaihi so allah with certainty that allah has answered you before you even finish the dua know that allah has heard and accepted that dua how will that do i manifest that's a different story maybe allah is saving the reward of this dua for the hereafter like the questioner said for something better or maybe allah will give it to you the way you want or maybe he will give it to you slightly different in this world but either you're going to get it in this world in one way shape or form or you're going to get something better for it so absolutely you have to make dua it's it's like a command from like it is a command from the prophet s with certainty that allah has answered you don't ever waver in your belief with allah okay the next question is so long i'm gonna have to paraphrase i think it's from the same person um the person is fearful uh terrified of death of their loved ones misfortune and tragedy and they see tragedy all around them but they feel so blessed in their own life and even though the whole world is going through you know catastrophe after catastrophe they are not i know i will eventually experience the death of those i love but i pray to allah for it to come an old age as opposed to when it is best for me and them how do i deal with these feelings and also how sometimes it makes me feel like the dua i make is wrong and or futile i fear allah's power but somehow because this messes with my idea of his mercy i worry if this is the right kind of fear to have the prophet sallallahu salaam he said strange is the affair of the believer because their affair is always good either something is good and they are grateful or something is bad and they are patient so the the question or seeing the world going through catastrophe and feeling blessed this is a sign of belief because the believer is always optimistic the believer is always in a relationship and a conversation with allah subhanahu ta'ala either there is here you know there's actual good that's come now so i'm i'm i feel the blessing and i see the blessing and i thank allah for the blessing or there are tough times but i'm patient and i know that the prophet sasam had tough times and the sahaba had tough times and i'm happy with what allah has given me most people are not like that most people if you inconvenience them one percent they think it's the end of the world look at look at the covet of the last couple of years the great inconvenience that people have gone through left people depressed worried out of business uh the fragility of life so most people muslims included if you inconvenience them just one percent they they can't tolerate it because we are entitled we feel that we deserve more but the believer who's whose life is connected to their belief in allah they know that everything comes from allah so they are satisfied so somebody who feels like this somebody who feels like this this is a sign of belief itself this is a sign that they are alive in their relationship with allah subhanahu ta'ala that they see the blessings and the bounties of allah upon them if you come to enumerate all the blessings you have you cannot enumerate them so even though things out there seem to be going bad you're like you know alhamdulillah life is good that's the life of the believer that's the attitude of the believer what are the different stances on reading from the mushaf in fardh or sunnah prayers the difference of opinion for the hanafi's they believe that reading from the must-have in prayer invalidates the prayer for the shafi's and for the maliki's it's okay that we read the mushaf in the prayer read from the muslim in the prayer as long as it doesn't distract us or the movement is not too much the hanafi's argue that the movement of just holding and flipping the page invalidates the prayer so it's a difference of opinion and as i said when there's a difference of opinion we are allowed to follow that which is most compatible with our situation so in this day and age i would say it's important to to facilitate a relationship between you and the quran so don't worry about the dispute don't do something that will prevent you at the end of that sentence not holding the quran that's what's important because sometimes people they follow these rulings because oh i grew up hanafi or i grew up in the subcontinent or i grew up here in north africa and what ends up happening is that their reasoning keeps them away from the quran at the end on the balance sheet that's not good so if you standing and praying holding the mushaf or reading from the app on the phone will facilitate you reading more quran and praying that's the opinion you should follow and don't worry about the dispute i'll go to the chat questions when we're done we hear that in wine or alcohol rather it should be there is good some goodness but we avoid it because on the whole it is bad for us are there ever scenarios where the reverse is true there is bad in some things but the overall good makes it permissible well as sunni muslims we believe that good and bad are what allah tell us are good and bad as it relates to reward and punishment in the hereafter which means that not everything that allah told us is good and not everything that allah told us is bad we will not necessarily have a rational explanation for and that's why this is a faith not a philosophical school this is a religion based on iman based on faith so i say that in the beginning so that we understand i understand what the question is trying to say but but it's also important for us to understand how we define good and bad good is allah tells me a is good which means if i do good if i do a now i will have a reward for it in the hereafter allah says be is bad which means if i do be now i will earn a sin for it and i can be punished for it that's what good and bad are are there things that are halal that are bad of course like polygamy polygamy is halal and it's one of something that's abused and something that could be disastrous divorce the prophet saws it's the most dislike of the halal thing is a man and a wife becoming divorced because it severs the family etc but the sharia deals with the reality of the human condition the reality of the human condition is that not all marriages will work the reality of the human condition is that on a global level not necessarily in our context as westerners but on a global level something like polygamy on the balance sheet will help with societal problems more than harm but on an individual base somebody came to me and said i want to marry you know just somebody from our community i want to marry a second or third wife i say no don't do that that's that's that's wrong you'll create a mess you'll create a fitna it's perfectly halal it's the prophet sasan did it himself it's mentioned in the quran so as we say not everything that is permissible is doable because you can create a scenario by doing permissible things that the scenario itself is bad so yes absolutely that can happen and that's why we have to ask people's advice ask the people of knowledge if you do not know in the past you advised that we can combine some prayers for no reason can this be done in jamaat as well for instance we are meeting at the house at mechrib and asha is drawing near can we combine and pray in congregation or should this be done individually no you can pray in congregation like right now at the time of this it's raining outside and it's heavy rain it's not normal rain so we pray maghrib we can combine aisha with marib so we would do that as a community therefore to alleviate the burden of people having to come back to the mosque to pray i share now this is for a reason of course because of the rain but in the fatwa of combining for no reason it's the same thing you can come you can combine at home with your family and pray in jamaat i need you need your language i don't have an articulate answer for this i'm fueled by faith and seek allah's kindness and mercy every day everything is his will question to explain to a new convert how can god whose most frequent attributes are raheem allow genocide in human cruelty child abuse and the holocaust why do good things happen why do bad things happen to good people or you know natural calamities again remember what we said a few minutes ago about our belief that allah is the creator that nothing happens except that allah except that allah allows it to happen etc we also need to understand that this world that we live in now is a portion of our life it's not all of our life as a matter of fact it is the most uh minute part of our life from the time we were created before time itself allah become and we were placed in the in the genetic material of adam alaihissalam until our earthly life which will last you know what 80 90 years and then we are resurrected for life ever after so this 80 90 years is like in the grand scheme of all that's like two minutes so you have to remember that this world that we occupy is fleeting very very you know before you know it it's over so these natural calamities that we rightfully say are bad because we are human and we see them as they are calamities could very well be the cause of those people entering into paradise so when we judge on these things we have to unders we have to look at life with a capital l not just this worldly life an innocent child dies innocent people die but those people will be saved so on the uh when you see them in paradise are you going to say that this was unfair or bad you'd be like oh i wish that happened to me that's what we would say i wish i had that because when we look back to this life we will see that it was only a couple of minutes so when we get to the hereafter after our life after this life and we look back at this life we will we will re-judge all of the things that we are experiencing now so you have to keep that perspective in understanding that allah's mercy parents who lose a child for example but that's a cause of those parents entering paradise they live with this pain their whole life that they lost a child or lost a child at birth or lost a child to an accident but that pain that will last is a finite amount of pain will lead to life ever after so when you see them with their children reunited you won't you say wow you're so lucky of course you're not going to say that now but you have to remember that there is this this span of of existence in life is watching boxing ufc permissible i'm pretty sure that there's a hadith which prohibits us from hitting each other and the face and the men have their aura exposed so i'm not sure if i should watch it or not biany the the ultimate they differ when it comes to things like boxing and physical sports because some argue that it's professional and they are fighting in a professional way and they know how to uh fight in a way that that is you know not like a street fight essentially um i personally i would never say that it's haram but i personally dislike that because i i see the great i mean i when i watch it i i i i don't see how this is professional it seems like people are beating each other and there's blood everywhere and i would hate to be in that position so you know i'm not a fan of that but i wouldn't say it's haram because there are many people greater than me who have said that it's permissible because it's a sport because any other sport football american football or soccer rugby these type of things the same type of injuries can happen it's physical but the point of that of those sports is not necessarily to injure somebody the point is to to strike a certain way to hit a certain way so from that point of view if it's done professionally it can be done professional as far as the aura is concerned there are different definitions of the aura for the man especially on the malikis that would make you know short trunks or something like that permissible so it's not the issue of the aura it's really the issue about hitting as for the hadith yet the prophet saw sam said not to strike people in the face because adam alaihissalam was created like that not not meaning that adam was created in the image of god as his count is is oftentimes misinterpreted but not striking someone's face because adam's face was like that face because we are bani adam that's what the hadith means so yeah there is a hadith that says that but then there are limits to that hadith because if you're in warfare you're not going to be concerned about that you're concerned about you know killing the enemy or defending yourself so the hadith also is talking about normal context can someone make wudu with sunscreen on if the sunscreen prevents the water from touching the skin then it would not count because then the the water has not penetrated the skin or the face so you would have to remove the sunscreen and you would have to then make wudu because the sunscreen would be a hat it would be a a cover just like you can't make wudu over your clothes you have to roll up your sleeves or take off you know if you or if your head is covered or something like that so if it's one of those heavy type of sunscreens it has to be removed before the wood was made how are dreams to be understood in islam i feel as if though people in my family and even culture overreact for example i've heard that if you see a snake in your dream it means you have an enemy and if it bites you they've done damage also i've heard when you see a dream of this sort you should give sadaqah is this islamic or cultural dreams should be interpreted loosely not not in great detail because the dreams are general messages and there's a portion of our nafs in the dream as well so the dream might be a you know so for example it's like either positive or negative that's it it's not like oh the snake did this oh it means this or the snake did that o means it's not like that at all because you could have been watching a movie and there was a snake in the movie that's why you dreamt of a steak it could be nothing whatsoever at all or it could be that you're gonna get stung by a bee the next day it could be as simple as that or you're going to spill coffee on the kitchen floor so it's not it's not like micro details oh if you dream it's like a dream if you dream this then this happens if you dream this it's not like that at all and people that do that those are the people you should be very careful from because almost guarantee you that they're lying because no one can interpret dreams like that but there could be general meetings i had a good dream it's as simple as that as far as the sadaqa is concerned the sadaqah is a general preventative you know to if you're sick you give sadaqah if you are going through difficulty you give sadaqav you know it's it's a it's a positive idea cure your ill by giving sadaqah so when people are sick you give sadaqa on their behalf it's a way of helping to cure them but not necessarily when it comes to dreams can you explain aya 29 of surat al-hijjaf which is so then fall and make sajdah this is commonly misinterpreted by muslims to believe that allah a portion of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala was placed into adam yeah you know without i mean that's that's we don't believe that that's not what the verse means when allah says my soul it means the soul that i created like we call the kaaba baytullah the house of allah doesn't mean allah lives in the kaaba so when allah refers something to himself it's to exalt that thing so allah is saying this soul which i created this unique creation which i created i place this into adam it doesn't mean that it's like allah took from his soul and put it in adam like that that's not what it means at all so allah's allah's create this creation that allah created uh baitullah the house of allah allah exalts the kaaba by referring it to him nabi ullah this is the prophet of allah same thing when is prayer because i've heard it's when the redness leaves the sky can you give a general estimate how much time after that would be around here in the dmv area as of now and would it be more time to pray in the winter again difference of opinion the shafi's all of the ulama agree that marib ends when the shafak disappears the problem is that they understood that word shaft to be different so for the shafes and the malikis and the hambalis we say it's when the red and the horizon disappears the hanafi's say it's the red and the white in the horizon when they disappear so there's a difference of opinion but let's forget about that difference of opinion for now when the sun sets when the disk of the sun sets below the horizon that's the beginning of mahdi prayer when that redness disappears that's the end of marib and the beginning of aisha which is not the same time it depends where in the world you are it depends what season you're in like the questioner said whether it's winter or whether it's summer and that's why in the prayer schedules we determine that by estimating the angle that the sun is beneath like let's say this table is the surface the sun is going to go down at what angle is the sun this is straight and then the sun is descending like this this angle what is the angle at which time aisha is yeah and it's around 18 19 degrees 17 say 18 degrees around 18 degrees every degree the sun moves is four minutes so see 18 times four that will give you an average roughly but you have to you know it depends on the time of year and where you are and things like that especially of course it can it can also uh change if you're in like the northern latitudes in northern europe or in the in the very south uh in which sometimes there are places where the sun never sets so you have to take what i'm saying with a grain of salt as far as it concerns the middle part or or latitudes around the equator the the more north you go this could also change if you pray after that 18 degrees if you miss mehreb then that becomes kada so the means you've missed that a lot of time that the sharia has given you to perform that act you still have to pray but it's called not adequ and that means you've prayed it at its time so if you're in this situation and you feel like you're going to miss merib make an intention to combine it with asha and that way you won't sin and you won't miss prayer now of course for the hanafi's then the prayer will be longer so that's another loophole is you can just follow the the hanafi opinion and you have to wait until the white goes this the 18 degrees that i gave you this is for the majority of schools the shaffer the hana the shafi's the malikis and the humbans okay wondering how to approach teens who may express that they don't want to get married or have kids should this be ignored and hope it will go away or addressed in a more specific way if upon exploring the child does have an attraction to the same gender how should a parent support the child in a loving and islamic way how can parents help their child pass this test how can parents pass this test michelle all the questions today are these big you know philosophical questions i like the rapid rapid-fire questions um the first thing i would say is that we we need to remember that there's a difference between being getting married and having children so sometimes we lump those two together as one concept so people can get married and not have children either because they don't want to have children or because they can't have children or you know whatever the case may be so having children is not an obligatory part of being married it's it's usually a part of being married but it's not an obligation so that's one distinction that i think is important to make imam he said when there are bad times like our times this is imam ishefa who died in the year 204 of the hijra and were in the year 1443 he said when there are bad times like our times it's it's a fitness to have children it's he doesn't advise to have many children and the hadith that the prophet saws said you know get married and have children because i will show off you imam sheikh he said he said after the muslim ummah reached like two 300 people we fulfilled that hadith so we don't need more muslims that was his argument and his understanding so there is something to be you know there is room in the sharia that people don't want to have children or want to have limited amount of children but this like uh catholic thing where like you know everyone has like 18 kids like that's not our way it doesn't have to be like that so that's the first thing the other thing is marriage let's focus on marriage now that's important and i think that that's something that it has to be or should be uh culturally um there should be like a pr i don't want to use the word peer pressure because that's negative but you know there should be like a cultural pressure in a positive way that that's normal because who wants to be by themselves marriage is protection marriage it's a sunnah of humanity such as the sunnah of islam it keeps you from being lonely you have companionship and i think the reason people don't want to get married is that they see many failed marriages and they see many people that are married that complain and they see many bad examples so for those of us who are married we need to give good examples and show good examples and talk about good examples and talk about you know the soul mates and women as well for both the man and the woman and that marriage is a journey to find your other half and that's why we refer to it as completing your faith and we need to emphasize those aspects of marriage in our community and in our homes so people feel like oh that's i want to get married that's like normal like when i was growing up that was [Music] you know everyone i knew was like yeah i can't wait to get married or i can't wait to do that it was considered like that's what you're supposed to do because there's a cultural component to that that informs that and i have also noticed like the question or people like i don't want to get married uh and you ask them why it's because they think marriages is a whole litany of problems and negatives so one of the things that we can do as a community is to to talk about those examples and as i said for us that are married to reassess how we speak about our own marriage and to separate that from the issue of having children like the idea that i'm gonna get married and the woman is like the baby factory and like that that that uh cultural understanding is not gonna be applicable in our context at all it's never gonna work there are parts in the world and that works you know i i know people and i know countries and tribal based countries and stuff like that where that totally makes sense because it's about survival and there are threats on the community and the tribe and the existence of the nation and the home the homeland there are places in the world where that is a that is true that's not our context here so we also have to separate what is first principles of our faith and cultural understandings same-sex uh attraction uh the part of the question about the same sex attraction look i'm gonna say some things are not gonna be necessarily politically correct but you know so what life is short um there's a difference between feelings and acting on those feelings and when we talk about homosexuality that's how we talk about it in islam to make the point clear that homosexuality that which is not permissible in islam is the act because the sharia deals with acts the acts of the morally obligated people what is the ruling of drinking alcohol what is the ruling of doing this what is the ruling of doing that it's an action the sharia doesn't govern the feelings so i might feel like i hate this person in front of me but you know i'm not gonna but i don't want to express that because i'm like stuff why don't i like this person i don't know i just this gets on my nerves and then i'm like you know may allah bless them and just keep me away from them well then i've just turned that negative feeling into a into a positive act i've been rewarded because i made dua for my brother behind their back positively so feelings are just feelings so one thing is my advice is when it comes to this is you need to catch this issue at the beginning if you let it grow without addressing it and assuming that it's going to go away they are going to interpret those feelings in a way that is not compatible with our narrative and you might get to a point along the line where it's too late you won't be able to share with them our idea of it same-sex attraction could be could be permissible if it's not acted on it could just be like a feeling it could be a feeling of just companionship or friendship but it's important that we explain to our children well no i mean we believe in a certain thing that allah created men and women have created them allah not just men and women allah says everything we have created into a male and female partner allah created the genders male and female i mean it's there's so many verses that explicitly state that there are two genders it's male and female there are two pairs everything has a pair so that the pairs can be placed together so on and so forth this is the sunnah of the world and this is how the story of human history so just because i feel something doesn't mean i need to act on it there's a sunnah of how we have been created and the cultural component i think is important and my advice is to be involved in that as soon as possible because i have dealt with with some of these issues in this community in other communities and my experience while it's not necessarily vast as my experience in other areas is that when people leave it it gets too far along khalas the dominant culture of the lgbt you know q narrative takes over and then somebody likes me i sound like a neanderthal no one wants to hear anything that we're saying because it's too far far along so my advice is to get involved as soon as possible okay the last several questions i believe we had before but i'll answer them quickly is the lottery haram we said yes because it's a form of gambling that's a waste of money you're never going to win anyway is being superstitious haram yes because we believe in and this was one of the main problems of the jehali arabs is that they were superstitious and this is one of the things that the prophet saws came to correct can you start with to do something midway and finish your wudu afterwards or must it be completed it's entirely consecutively the default is that acts of worship are to be done consecutively so like when you read in the hadith that the prophet saws at the end of the prayer would say subhanallah 33 alhamdulillah 33 the default understanding is that you do that consecutively in the wudu let's say i'm making wudu and i get a phone call and it's my wife and i oh what's wrong and i answer is everything okay yeah i'm making can i call you back and then i go back and i continue where i left off it's fine but if i talk to my wife and that my body has dried the last part of my body has dried when i come back to make wudu i'll start over how long are you islamically morally responsible for your children financially well as long as they need support but that doesn't mean you have to lavishly support them when they're 45. it just so it depends i mean how do you answer that question you're not going to leave your kids to starve but you know you don't you don't have to buy them a tesla and that's like financial support so the devil's in the details it depends what you mean by that but our children are our children it's not like oh you're 18 today sadamaikum that's not our way your children are your children but you know you're going to encourage them and then the last question that i received prior but there are some on the chat in a typical average one hour window between fajr and sunrise to when can you still pray before it's considered makru same thing about the asha prayer it's not one standard time the the sun now is rising fajr is before the sun rises so then it's an itchy head how many degrees below the surface of the earth or sorry below my horizon how many degrees below is the sun when fajr starts this is called astronomical twilight which means nothing to anybody but is is pretty much the fifth definition or the english translation of the word true fajr because there's something called al-fajr the false faith which happens before that again what was the degree i gave for who said 18. and in 19.5 degrees that's when federer will start when does feder end when you see the disc of the sun rise sunrise that's when fedger ends so you have to you can you can determine with the app and you can figure out around that time when is it when is it disliked to pray towards the end when it's like light outside and like you see the red and like you know moments the sun will rise that's when it's disliked so you should try to pray a little bit before that which is tough in the summertime because it's so early okay some of these questions in the use of the evil eye symbol is the use of the evil eye symbol or object's shirk no because the the the blue eye and those type of things ward the person's eye away from what is the evil eye evil eye it's like a type of hara it's like a type of heat or energy that comes from a person um so people put it like at the front of the house or something like that to take away that person's glance to break that glance so whatever if that negative energy that's coming out of that person will not come on you or your children or the house so the allah understand this as like a natural phenomena it's not about belief it doesn't have to be a blue eye it could be anything it could be uh you know some weird object that you put at the front of your house or something like that the point is when somebody comes you know when they go like that then you've broken that glance it could be like some ugly thing or it can be i don't know some weird object that doesn't belong in the front of the house but the point is it it breaks the person glance it's not shirk with the new images from nasa there has been much discussion on the possibility of intelligent life beyond that found on earth what has generally been the commentary on this subject in the tradition alhamdulillah plural allah is the world the lord of the worlds not just this world but the worlds we believe in the ins and we believe in the jinn is there life out there most likely and there's not that's completely compatible with our belief and there's nothing wrong with that are there people like us out there probably not if that if there were that would be pretty weird but it's it doesn't change any of our belief or anything like that again this is the the judeo-christian narrative this our narrative is completely different we believe in the jinn for god's sake we believe in another creature another sentient rational creature that we don't see and we believe in the angels and we say he said there's like 18 or 20 worlds out there so there's certainly of course life out there in some way shape or form there's not a problem with us all of that stuff that we see we see it we say subhanallah can you explain that the period for a woman following the death of her husband and its requirements four months and 10 days that the woman whose husband is deceased spends the night he sleeps in the house in which she was when her husband died it doesn't mean that she's trapped in the house she can go out for work and go out to the store and do this and do that but she spends the night at this at this um at the marital house or wherever she was let's say the woman is sick or she's too frail to be by herself right when the husband dies she moves in with her sister or brother or children and then she continues she starts the edda from there that's fine if she breaks the edge then she breaks the edda but the is a huge reward for the woman it's so powerful that the overcomes even hajj it will even supersede something like hajj if it happens during the time of hajj so therefore there is an amazing amount an immense amount of spiritual reward for the woman who engages in this act can you give us a simple definition of tawheed we are told that as per islamic ruling after delivery of a baby the placenta should be buried so firstly we wanted to know if that's true and a valid islamic way of disposing the placenta don't walk out of the hospital the placenta let the hospital deal with it don't say this is my religion and be one of those people okay so maybe yeah that's a tradition but don't we're going to walk out i've seen the placenta before i'm happy that the nurses took care of that what is the ruling ruling about organs that are removed from the body like gallbladder or appendix do they have to be buried as well yeah there are some traditions about that body parts people that lose a body part that bury the body part but again in in the medical system that we have you let the hospital dispose of that with a way that's appropriate because there are contaminants and chemicals and things like that that are involved now that we're not necessarily a concern like they're saying this month we're going to reach 8 billion people on earth at the time of the revelation there were what 50 million people on earth or something like that i mean you have to put things in perspective you
