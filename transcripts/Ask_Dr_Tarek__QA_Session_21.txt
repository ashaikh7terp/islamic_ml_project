welcome everyone to our open question answer session my apologies that the announcement went out a little bit late that's partly my fault I had forgotten that we needed to schedule this in the month of January but that being said I have quite a few questions I think I have 29 by my counting 29 questions and they're all meaty so we'll just jump right in Insha'Allah and in no particular order and of course the questions are anonymous question number one is it too late to start memorizing the Quran and I am in my mid-40s is it could you guide me through an efficient method first of all no it's not too late and one shouldn't think about that's kind of like how shaitan plays with us so no don't think about it as it's later it's early or anything like that this is where you are now Allah put in you this desire to memorize the Quran so inshallah you memorize the Quran and memory is like a muscle that just needs to be exercised so my suggestion is whenever we would ask this question they advised us to memorize the ottoman way so what is the ottoman way of memorizing the Quran first of all you need to have a Quran that has 15 lines per page the ottomans are the ones that printed the Quran that way or if before the print they wrote the Quran in the manuscript form that way and that's based on a Hadith of that whoever memorizes the Quran five by five will never forget it so the page is 15 lines it begins with one verse and it ends with one verse and the the Quran that's printed in the Medina printing press that's how it's printed it's called and that is that's number one number two is you're going to memorize the last page of each juice first so you go to the first Jews each Jews is about 20 pages so when you open the must-have and you go to the first Jews you're not going to start on the first page you're going to go to the last page of the first Jews and then after you memorize that page you're going to go to the last page of the second Jews and then the last page of the third Jews all the way to 30 and then when you have those 30 pages memorized you go back to the first Jews and then you memorize the second to last page of the first truth the second to last page of the second just no one knows why but this is the this way works and the Ottomans and the modern day Turks they've produced uh I mean we wouldn't be an exaggeration to say hundreds of thousands of so this is the way that I recommend first having the most first of all you need to have the same Quran the same so if you're going to get the Medina Quran you need to get like a couple of those copies because when you memorize the Quran and you keep going through it every day there's wear and tear and sometimes the spine or the must-have gets damaged Etc so make sure that you get three four five of those copies and then try memorizing that way and just take it easy when you come to memorize the page break down the page in either in half or in thirds or in force so you can have bite size and it's just about repetition and then then all you really need to do is dedicate the time and if you follow that method within about three years you should have the unmerized inshallah okay I do not understand Arabic is it too late for me to study Arabic but I can read Arabic and the Quran will my recital be as blessed as those who understand Arabic again like the question about the Quran you're never too late to learn uh quranic Arabic is different than Arabic in general so there are courses and resources for quranic Arabic to give you a better understanding of the Quran and the verses of course reading the Quran understanding it is more beneficial than reading the Quran and not understanding I mean it goes without saying but that does not diminish from the blessings of reading the Quran even if you don't understand it because the Quran is a shifter it is a source of healing so even if you read the verses of the Quran they're still going to have spiritual impact on you because it's real it's something it's not something that's made up it's something that's real but when it comes to learning in general you're never too young uh to learn or too old to learn and you shouldn't think about it that way it just takes time and dedication is it haram for women to have undercuts or short haircuts does it matter if one wears hijab as people wouldn't see the hair anyway the prophet saws Whoever has hair let them honor it so the uh it's the only thing that's impermissible is it's impermissible for a woman to shave her head unless there's a medical reason of course so that's the only thing but as far as making the hair short or long it's it's just as long as you take care of your hair and you honor it because this is a gift that Allah has given you it says irrespective of the hijab issue covering the hijab a woman wearing the hijab she still has to she's still obligated to take care of her hair doesn't mean don't take care of your hair so the hijab is one thing and honoring the hair and that goes for men as well honoring the hair taking care of it is part of the Sunnah of the Prophet is but if a woman wants to cut her hair I mean she doesn't have to it doesn't have to be like Rapunzel I mean that's fine if she cuts it but not to shave it okay I never made up my fast from my period during Ramadan because I just don't know any I didn't know any better no one told me I needed to make them up before the next Ramadan so for 15 plus years I've calculated I owe more than 200 fast I need to make up should I figure out a plan to somehow make up the fast in my lifetime fasting once a week for example or is that pointless if one is supposed to make up the fast before the next Ramadan it seems like a fidia and kafara don't apply in the situation unless I'm mistaken what's the best way to tackle this of course the focus have different opinions about this don't follow the opinion the the fast has to be made up by the next Ramadan because then you're just going to get into this rut so uh we don't give that opinion the opinion that we give is the easy opinion which is you just have to make up the days don't worry about the cafe or the fidget just make sure that you make up the days as best as you can and then there are many Sunnah fast throughout the year you can fast Mondays and Thursdays you can fast the middle days of them months the 13th the 14th and the 15th of the lunar months there's also uh the 15th of Shaban there's the uh six days of shawel there's the first 10 days of dulheja so on Ashura on the 10th of marham so there are many Sunnah days to fast uh that will kind of like motivate you as long as your intention is that you're making up your father days during those days you'll get double the rewards so don't worry about paying or feeding as long as you are physically able to fast make up the fast inshallah put together a plan and before you know it you will fast before you know it you'll make up those days inshallah can I do Sunnah fasts for the deceased well you you can fast on behalf of someone who has passed away who owes fast the only thing you can't do for the deceased is pray for prayers that they haven't prayed because prayer is something specific for each person it's it's just under the rubric of any uh meritorious act you can pray for them read the Quran for them give charity for them fast for them and donate their reward to that so on and so forth that's all fine uh uh don't aren't we able to go Hajj for people who have passed away yes doesn't Hajj include everything all of the acts of worship yes so everything can go with the exception of the prayer because the prayer is something that's specifically tied to each individual but all of the other acts of korba of devotional acts all of them go to the deceased when we do it on their behalf we can get together for example and we could each person take a juice of the Quran and we read the Quran and we finish it and then we make Dua and then we donate the reward of that of the Quran uh to the deceased why not we could all as a matter of fact there are many communities that will do this all the time every month they will have a cycle they'll have like a WhatsApp group or an Excel sheet and you sign up for your juice and then you read a just uh and every month they do this for the deceased of their community so there's nothing wrong with that and these are good things uh to do because when we're we're dead we will want people to make Dua for us as well inshallah as for the people who are obsessed with the death that nothing goes to the dead people those people are The Walking Dead Danny just forget about them you know they're they're walking dead and their problem is that they don't understand death you see that's the thing they think that death is the end of life but it's not the end of life they think that they're material they don't realize it but they're just a form of the modern world they just see it they think death is like you just turn off the lights it's over if it's over then why do we wash the body shroud the body pray for the body and bury them why do we do all why don't we just throw the body in the dumpster or burn it if it's over well because it's not over that's why we do we wash the body with lukewarm water make sure one of the Washings has you know a camphor or some nice scent the white shroud at least three why do we do all of these things because the person is in another state of living they've left this world but they're in another state of living so we honor them by helping them transition to the next world so if you understand that belief then you will understand that we make Dua and we we can fast for them and donate do charity for them so on and so forth could you please go into a little detail on the rulings and conditions around a Muslim man marrying a Christian or Jewish woman if the couple actively decide not to raise the children as Muslim is the marriage still valid Daniel why don't you guys have to ask these type of questions so this is a uh an issue in which I was taught one thing but I personally slightly differ from the way I was taught so to be faithful to the tradition of course in the methods it's much more flexible it's permissible for a Muslim man to marry a Jewish woman or Christian woman in the other madahib it's not because that ruling no longer is applicable so in my method in the SharePoint method that's technically not valid anymore but we don't have to get into that let's just assume that we follow the position that say it's it's valid what do you want me to say the couple it actively decides not to raise their children as a Muslim obviously that's not a good thing I'm not going to say it's a good thing and that's one of the the threats one of the problems with Interfaith marriages is that faith is the is what is lost and sacrificed um you can't raise a child to be uh religion fluid and values fluid it doesn't work you have to teach a child what's right from what's wrong what makes you say that this is right and this is wrong it's your ethical Paradigm where does that come from it comes from religion at the end of the day all people on Earth that that Advocate principles and right and wrong it comes from somewhere even if they don't acknowledge it where does it come from it comes from the religious Traditions whether it's judeo-christian tradition the Islamic tradition uh the hindic tradition Buddhism Confucianism yeah the whole thing in China all of their the way that they operate in in public society that oscillates between the principles of confusion teachings and Taoism even though it's a communist secular State it's but that's where those principles come from so it's impossible to raise a child with with oscillating between sets of principles because these principles also stem from a world view so what ends up happening from what I've observed what ends up happening is that children end up taking the culture of the religion so they participate in cultural things holidays Foods dresses maybe things of speech but that's not Islam right that's not religion that's just a byproduct religion is that we have faith and that we act on this Faith by conducting our prayers and our fast Etc and et cetera et cetera so that's obviously not a good way to go about it is it permissible yes if there's a Muslim man and there's a Jewish and Christian woman that come and ask for nikah I conducted because what's the alternative the alternative is that they live in Haram so at least by doing the we've done something that's compatible with one of our opinions but unfortunately from what I have seen I have yet to see a scenario in where this works so I caution people seriously about this and you need to really think twice about what is it that you want out of life for your children so on and so forth okay I usually leave the three Witter in my eyeshadow and say them after tahajud a few minutes before Fajr then my question is that if I missed ahead because I overslept what should I say when should I say my Mist with I heard that missed wits can be made up between the Sunnah and prayer of Fajr can you put some light on this matter this is an issue of the hanafi method because the hanafis are the ones that say that the wicked prayer is obligatory the other methods they don't so if you miss if I miss with her then I miss which it's over it's it's a Sunnah for me it's a Sunnah so if I miss it I miss it now that being said the minimum amount of winter prayer is one raqqa it doesn't have to be three so you could wake up and and just pray one rakam that's your winter prayer or in this situation you can take the same excuse me the safer option and pray with her before you sleep now what happens if you pray with her you go to sleep and then you wake up again and you want to pray again right this is a common question that we get because people have like the fear of the curse of Salah they feel like they prayed Salata now they don't know what to do it's fine pray again and then pray two more winter because the prophet saws said there's no two with in one night so let's say you take the minimum with one raka I pray one rock and then I go to sleep and then I wake up half an hour before fetching I pray a couple more Sunnah then I'll pray one raka salaam salaam so that one raka and the first one raka are how many two so then I pray a third raka just one salaam now I've done three so I've done one with her in one night and no problem so it's very easy if you're a hanafi you're going to make up your wizard when you can just like you would make up one of your father prayers so it depends I mean my suggestion is to find is to follow the easier opinion to facilitate if you find yourself not doing extra good works because you're stuck in some sort of cultural Islam that you've inherited and there's another opinion that's valid that know that that shaitan is playing with you so if there's an easier opinion you know we we want to find ourselves it's easy it's easy to practice Islam these are easy issues and we're motivated to do it that's what we should do but if you find something getting in the way who's the one that's getting in the way it's shaytan can I preach the three records of winter all together with a break after the first two you can pray them two and one like we do in this mosque in Ramadan or you can pray them three together with two sittings or you can pray them three together with one sittings or like I say you could pray them one raka I hope that's clear but I know Ramadan will get the question again recently we heard the story of the holy prophet saws chest being opened and his heart washed and that the same incident occurred a few times in his blessed life I have two questions about this one were these actual physical experiences or visions no these were actual experiences witnessed by people and the scar on the prophet's chest saw sallam were the Angels sutured his chest was visible it was a visible part of his physical body because there were multiple times in which the prophet saws was shirtless like in the battle of the ditch when he was digging and he broke the the big boulder he was shirtless so these there were times when his chest was exposed number two if we are born without sin and the prophet saws was sinless why did this need to happen multiple times through his blessed life that's a very good question so and as I said in my the shifa class the last class I alluded to it that the Allama have many different approaches in explaining this aspect in the prophet's lifestyle one of the reasons that this happened is to prepare the prophet saws physically for the Israel because the Israel in the Maharaj is a journey through the levels of Heaven that the normal human being with our normal body can't take just like we can't go to outer space without a suit and depressure this and pressure Chambers and things like that we can't be exposed to say we would die and within seconds so you can imagine that a journey beyond that beyond that realm to the Angelic Realms and above and beyond that the prophet saws body needed to be prepared for that that's one explanation another explanation as I said is that it's not that there was sin in the prophet's chest but that the prophet saws would have had mercy even for Satan so for him to be just that was removed so he was so merciful he would have even had mercy for shaitaan which is a completely different meaning than the shaytan whispering to us so there are multiple ways of explaining that that honor the great status of the prophet sallallahu and as I said it happened multiple times at least three times when he was a child when he first received the Revelation and the night of the Israel and there are other lesser strength narrations that will take the number up to five or six I've even read before so this is something that happened multiple times in his life if I carry an ink pen that has a gold clip on it is that okay for me as a male Muslim to carry I don't know if a gold clip on a pen is considered jewelry forbidden for Muslim men the problem with gold and silver is that gold and silver are the two substances that are used for the currency in Islam the dinar and the Dirham so all of them agree that you cannot use utensils and vessels made out of gold and silver so we cannot drink from a golden cup eat from a silver plate Etc however if the item is plated gold-plated silver plated we don't allow it the chef is don't allow but the hanafis allow it and in our books it says uh if you are struck with an issue like this as is common today this was written like a couple hundred years ago so follow the opinion that allows it meaning the hanafi opinion so the the pen clip is gold it's obviously not a solid piece of gold you're not that rich it's obviously not you probably was gifted so it's probably gold-plated then that would be okay uh but if it was a solid P if it was a solid gold pen that would not be permissible even according to the hanafis so gold plated silver plated as long as it is extra or an adornment or the item is studded by gold and silver in the hanafi method that's okay in the other methods it's not so there is some space in that so the person who has the gold it's not considered jewelry it's a the pen is considered a tool so my guess without seeing the pen is most likely I would if I was gonna bet it was it's probably gold-plated because if it was solid gold I mean that would be ridiculous so on and so forth so so when it comes to gold and silver the Sharia has a lot to say because gold and silver is what we use for currency as I said so what if the pen or the cup what if the cup was made out of emeralds what if we had an emerald cup and a dish made out of Platinum it's fine even though the cost of that is many many more full than the gold and silver so it's not about gold and silver because it's it's showing off or it's fancy or something like that it's because it has it's related to that gold and Silvers are the materials used for currency now we live in a non-gold and silver currency H but that's recent only from the 1970s and there are people now countries that are calling for gold Reserve I mean I'm not an expert in currency or policy or anything like that but the chances of that happening soon very very unlikely I mean the the reserve currency right now is the US dollar but still if there is something that is Haram in the Sharia and the reason why it's Haram has gone like in this case we still avoid it because there could be another reason in the Sharia that Allah has intended that we do not see so even though someone could come and say well we don't use gold and silver for currency so all of these rules about the utensils and the vessels we can we can cast them aside we say no if Allah told us to remove something then there could be even if it's just out of compliance and worship we do it okay if I make a mistake during the prayer what is the proper way to make that after you sit and you finish the tahit before you do salaam salaam you do Allah Akbar twice to do two sujud you come up is it permissible to say the Salah as a means of seeking blessings for someone who has passed away or is it recommended to stick to things like Yani the like I said before the prayer itself cannot be done on behalf of somebody else but you can make Dua in the prayer for the person so you can do that so don't be binary but the Allah says the prayer has been prescribed for each believer in its allotted time so we can't we can't do it on behalf of each other and that's how important prayer is by the way that there is never a circumstance in which you are you don't pray uh even in the thick of battle you have to pray what if like you're actually in the trenches in battle how do you praise you say Allah Akbar subhanallah that's it that's all you have to say and now you don't even have to make it up that's how in that's how important the prayer is what if you're Stark naked in a cave and you don't know which way the Qibla is or the time you still have to pray you have to make your best effort to pray some of them will say pray once this way once this way once this way and once this way for example so there's no circumstance and we do you can even pray with your eyes if you're lying down and you're sick and that's how important is by the way okay the next question is like four paragraphs I think I might summarize guidance on who to name as a guardian for my children part of the estate planning process for parents of minors includes naming a guardian for the children in the event that both parents die is there anything from the Quran or Sunnah that would provide guidance on the best person to name context generally speaking most advice comes in the form of capable God-fearing Muslims for most families the default tends to be the parents or siblings and my family's case both my wife and I have equally capable and willing Muslim parents that we want to name respectively foreign of course for example we cannot name both of our respective mothers as the primary guardians of our children I think the real reason behind this question is whoever wrote it is afraid of the other the in-laws side and they're trying to be very political and that's why I insisted that these questions be anonymous because I enjoy trying to understand the psychology by so first it was God-fearing guardians but now specifically says mothers of course we cannot name both our respective mothers so there's a mother-in-law issue here is there any advice that can be given on the Quran and certain examples that help my family think through this process to determine an order of preference inshallah the ultimate care of our children is in Allah's hands however I want to do my best et cetera et cetera et cetera okay so when it comes to the estate planning thing there are other factors I mean of course you need somebody who you think is going to take care of your parents as a matter of fact Imam his father who died when he remembered and his brother Ahmed were young the guardian was their you know a Pious neighbor and it was the pious neighbor who took Muhammad and uh I mean Ahmed the brother the younger brother or the other brother to this to the madrasa and had it not been for that we wouldn't have had Imam so you want somebody who's going to be able to over over overall make sure that they tend to your children's fundamental well-being that's important at the same time you need somebody who's physically capable somebody who's here somebody who who understands the language of the laws or somebody who's financially able to understand how to use the estate that's been left you know there has to be a little bit of literacy for that person so it's not necessarily the parents because it might be a burden for the parents but maybe your parents are aging so it all it all depends there's no it doesn't have to be a relative it could be somebody in the community that you trust that you come to an arrangement with so it's really too subjective for me to give a specific answer other than to say you have to have these two combinations you have to have somebody that understands that they owe these children depending of course on what age the children are the fundamental care to guide them the right way on the most deepest way that is compatible with our faith tradition that there's that's number one at the same time you know they need to be able to help them continue their life their lifestyle their schooling and and things like that so you need somebody that has that combination that's how is how I would answer that question and this is difficult because I and my wife and I we went through this a few years ago and it was actually very difficult to find the right person that we thought kind of ticked all those boxes so I speak from a little bit of experience um so if you're a guardian of a non-muslim same thing your job is to make sure that that child uh that you follow as best as you can their parents instructions for care of that child because the issue of faith is an issue that's that we have no control over you know um Allah is the one that guides we can't choose who is guided Islam of the Ottoman Empire he had a similar question that came to him and the question that came to him was uh as a young slave boy who is non-muslim is it better that that non-muslim slave boy be freed or sold into a Muslim family he said it's better that the slave boy be freed because the opportunity to earn your freedom can only will only come once in your life it's very rare but the opportunity to find Allah's multiple of Allah's door is always open So based on that line of thinking that's how you should think about this this situation yeah okay I usually another question subhanallah I usually leave the three waiters in my oh no this is a repeat what is a repeat able man okay sometimes sometimes I come just in time for Juma prayers and the mosque is crowded and there is space outside but in front of the Imam is my prayer accepted yes because in that regard we follow the position of Imam Malik and imamedic did not stipulate that the Imam be the the first person uh in the prayer lines it's not a condition where another medev of course it is so in our mosque out of necessity we follow Imam Malik's position uh because we have no other choice so that's fine but so not only is your prayer valid in sha Allah but the prayer of the Imam and everybody else what is the minimum distance between the mosque and a prayer space that is at a distance from one's prayer to be accepted if there's a space in between so if we are in one mosque in in the same building in the same mosque let's say this message is huge like a huge Masjid if you are inside the mosque and you can hear and follow the movements of the Imam that's fine so that's one scenario the other scenario is like in our mosque we have all of the rows they go back and that's the that's the Border that's the wall of the mosque and now there's a gap outside there are other people praying outside of the mosque what is the distance allowed between the last row the last row of the continuous rows and the people outside 144 meters or 472 feet that's the maximum amount of distance and I measured before the distance between the door here and the barn and it's less so if we had an Imam praying at the barn or the blacktop right prayer and would this actually happen so we pray I eat prayer in the on the basketball court all the way to the end of the basketball court and then the next group sometimes there are people praying here so the people praying here can still be part of the same Jamaal there because we are less than that space less than that amount so that's quite a 472 feet it's far if you count it out it's far during covid we did not stand shoulder to shoulder now that covert distancing is relaxed is it okay for me to still stand apart from the next person exercising an abundance of caution I mean you could do that but then you would really need to pray like at the last row or something but you can't I mean don't come in the front and then kick everyone off beside you that's not going to work so uh if you want to be very cautious and you know there are still people wearing masks and that's fine there's nothing wrong with any of that you have to do that on your own so you can pray like I said you'll have to pray by yourself or create your own row or off to the side or in the basement that's that's fine because the standing shoulder to shoulder is not a condition in all of them it's a it's definitely there's a Hadith about several Hadith about it so it's it's good form but some of them that they have did not consider did not interpret that Hadith as being a condition some of it some of them just interpreted as being asunna whereas obviously the majority of us say no it's that's how you pray so when covid came we adopted all of us around the adopted that position that said it's okay for obvious reasons because we had to so you could continue to do that out of abundance of caution but I fear that that would lead you to this thing of West West because then then where does it stop you don't want to shake people's hands you don't want to touch the doorknob then some people don't even want to go to the mosque because they're still scared so there has to be a little bit of Telecom but on this specific issue it's okay if you do it as I said sort of by yourself women pray behind the man the men in our mosque can men and women pray in the same line if there is an Isle separating the men and women yeah so if we had like a gap down the middle of the mosque and then the men prayed on one side and the women prayed on the other side but like maybe like one line back yeah that could work that I mean that's that's fine because in all of these large massages it's not always that the men are in front and the women are in the back it's just the men and women are separate but the women can't be in front of the men um so uh there is a way to do that yeah it's that's doable just because it's doable doesn't mean we're going to do it by the way I'm just answering the question so we have a system here it works and we're going to stay with that system so it doesn't we're not we don't not just because something is doable means we have to implement it at some fundraisers not in our mosque they mentioned the names of those who contribute well we mentioned the people that contribute when we know it does this take away from the blessing that is bestowed on the donor no not at all because we do that so that we can encourage one another so when when you see little kids and you know a kid saved up all year and donates to the mosque we want to honor that child we want the child to to to know how much we honor that and then that child donates uh motivates other children other young people to donate I remember the first fundraiser we had uh that was online during covid that first Ramadan there were so many children donating because everyone just got so excited seeing all the other kids donating so sometimes you name the person to encourage them so that's wrong and then the person who is donating if their name is mentioned it's on them that for them not to be arrogant or to be you know that's on them that's their own little struggle but sometimes we do that and we should especially the people that are the large donors so that we know that these are the people that sustain the mosque and let me tell you something else from my side of of the table uh you know throughout the year people come and they criticize they criticize me they criticize the mosque and let me tell you something 100 of the people that criticize these are not the people that donate so from my point of view because I know who donates sometimes we're told and the person wants to remain anonymous sometimes I don't know I just take the piece of paper and I give it to refill and I said this person donated but you know I do know more of the names than maybe you do and I'm telling you the people that complain and this is Haram and these people never donate these are not the people that that upon which the mosque is built and that's why it's important that you know who are the families who are the people that are really sacrificed why this place exists not just this place but any place that's very important because that will give you a clear picture of what the community is actually like I'm not trying to be disparaging with the people that criticize I'm not I'm full of mistakes and and I take the criticism honestly every time somebody criticizes I take it seriously I try to see in my heart if there's anything there so on and so forth alhamdulillah most of the criticism is just nonsense and just people making noise and ignorance and things like that uh but I don't I don't take that lightly but I'm giving you a snapshot a lot of the people that are the big donors they are not the people that come every day to the mosque and pray every German the most because they're out working and they have very active lives but yet they donate so when when we come to fundraise at this mosque or any mosque and then you realize that you know this person who you think you only see once a year at Aid or twice a year the two AIDS but they have donated every year fifty thousand dollars seventy five thousand dollars that's going to make you think like what am I doing for the mosque right so it's it's important so don't take it like that what does Hassan mean in fundraising a non-interest-bearing loan so I'm gonna give the mosque a hundred thousand dollars I'm giving this an example I'm not going to give the most countries because I don't have a hundred thousand dollars to give but I'm going to give the mosque a hundred thousand dollars which means that the mosque promises to pay me back at some point hopefully in the not too distant future the hundred thousand dollars back so it's a loan uh to to help facilitate the you know the finance of of things and it's a good Tool uh we haven't done a lot of it at this month or maybe we have but not you know publicly but it's a great tool because it's it's a way that people can give and that they know that you know they'll be able to make that take that money back if they need it but it's sometimes there are moments in the operation where you just need a you know a a gush of of Finance okay do I have to pay this account my jewelry and on cash deposits in the bank which is not interest bearing if you're a woman and you have jewelry in the chef I met up you don't have to pay zakah on the jewelry no matter how much jewelry you have whether you wear it or you don't as long as it's jewelry of course on the Hana fees you have to so obviously the person who's asking this question is from a hanafi background 100 because in the shaft by Method we know this if you're a man and you have jewelry even if it's Haram jewelry you have to pay zakat on it because it's not permissible for you to have the jewelry as far as cash deposit in the bank this is textbook zakah it's money that's in a drawer that's just sitting there if the money is above the Nissan which is the dollar equivalent of 84 grams of 21 karat gold or did we get 21 karat gold from versus 16 karat or 18 karat because the Dinars the gold denatas that were at the time of the Prophet saws the Roman denadas they are 21 karat gold so that is the that is what we base the the firk of the zakiron uh so um what was I saying oh the cash so if you have above then the sub amount I think I think the Nissan amount maybe is like fifty five hundred six thousand dollars around that right now I'd have to double check if you have that and it's just sitting in a bank account whether it's getting interest or it's not getting interest and it stayed in that account for a whole year you've got to pay 2.5 on that that's textbook it's okay do Christians and Jews believe in life after death yes they have they have eschatology of different differing views some of them it's very some of them is very compatible to us some of them is different but yes they believe in the afterlife because like us they believe in moral responsibility that you live in this life you're morally responsible and you will be judged for that um the people that don't believe in that version of the afterlife are the dharmic face in which there's just reincarnation because then there's there's no human that's why um is a fundamental part of our belief but the Jews and Christians we all and us and the zoroastrians we sh we share that can you briefly explain how the Motions of those in the Jewish faith pray as I have seen them standing in bowing we can talk about that another time because I don't I mean they just they Rock back and forth they face East and they Rock back and forth but I'm not I'm not a rabbi so we can ask the rabbi to come and explain that to us I mean so in limit of how much I one time Sheikh Muhammad Abdul a woman came up to him and she said she gave him to read this and he looked at it he's like but this is in French and she's like he's like this is in French and she said to him well why are you wearing the M why are you wearing the turban he said why don't you take my Emma and then you read it so I feel like this is this question I don't know how the Jews pray and there are all these different denominations and so on and so forth okay uh can we see the body after awesome yeah this seems to be an issue because this also came up recently in the winter break so there is there is uh dispensation for that you know he kissed the forehead of the Prophet saws after he was washed after the prophet saws had passed um but this thing about after the body's washed and shrouded and then we bring him to the mosque we had one one family we were like going out to the hearse and then they opened they're like wait and then they opened the the body and then they're like FaceTiming their family and I I wouldn't do that I'm not going to say it's Haram but I wouldn't do that I mean just get the person in the ground again that I mean don't take it the wrong way that's very selfish on the living because it's the living person who has the need to do that when the person dies we need to be thinking about the person who died what what do we need to do for them we need to get them to their home that's what we need to do so you know if I'm dead and my wife is crying and she wants to see my okay and it's not it's not the end of the world it's not Haram but we shouldn't make a thing at it you know the taking the picture of I mean don't take my picture when I'm dead just I'm dead how else it's over put me in the ground and pray for me inshallah okay there's this the next the last series of questions are all related to women uh women related issues so uh let me take those and then we can turn to if there's still time left we can answer other questions um okay so the sister says uh I do my wudu following all the steps including washing both of my feet and then I understand that we'll do remains until one or more of the following happens anything that is a natural discharge this refers to urine stool or passing of gas falling asleep becoming unconscious okay that's good my question is do we need to wash our feet three times again if we walk with our socks on in the carpeted floor or wear socks and sandals on the wooden tile floor in the house foreign if you make wudu and you wash your feet and then you put on a pair of socks and the socks cover your feet your toes your feet and go above your ankle think about it that the sock is now your foot it's a part of your foot if you make wudu at eight in the morning and then you put on socks and then you walk around the house and then you take off your socks at nine in the morning but you haven't lost your wudu then the issue is Moo because it doesn't matter because you put them on and you took them off all you had to do if you make we'll do at eight in the morning and you put on a pair of socks and then you lose your wudu at 8 30 and the socks are on you you can do one of two things either when you come and make a new wudu you wipe over the sock or you take them off and wash your feet again what you can't do is you can't make we'll do at eight in the morning lose your will do at 8 30. you'll make we'll do at eight in the morning put on a pair of socks lose your will do at 8 30. take off your socks and then put them back on and then make will do and wipe over your sock you can't do that so if you make wudu and put on your sock and lose your wudu you have to keep the sock on you for you be able to wipe over it that's what I'm trying to say okay so I hope that answers that how long should the wudu remain for praying Namaz and reading the Quran as long as you can hold it it's not because you can hold it so if you make wudu you you know he used to pray Fajr with his wudu of Asher yeah oh God right because in Ramadan when we're up all night I mean I make we do like 15 20 times I don't know how he did it because it's impossible I mean as far as I'm concerned it's impossible how do you do that but subhanallah they that's a that's one of the most uh baffling things for me because I've tried I was like okay tonight in Ramadan I'm not gonna I'm gonna do whatever style you don't make by the time you finish and you go home you got to use the bathroom so no you if you can hold it then you're fine even if it's two days let's say you're you don't sleep for 48 hours and you have the same will do that's fine it doesn't expire but if you wipe over your socks you have 24 hours from the time you lose your wudu so let's say I make wudu at six in the morning I put I wash my feet then I put on my pair of socks I praise and then I lose my Urdu at 10 in the morning while I'm wearing my socks I have from 10 in the morning till the next day 10 in the morning that 24 hour period to wipe over my socks if I was traveling in that same scenario I would have three days you could keep your socks on for three days and wipe over them maybe that's what the questioner is after if we forget to recite the shahada and Dua or would you not be completed no there's no the there's no the device that you make for wudu are also no you don't have to make them so that's fine or only if we recite the shahedah which I did not know until now and didn't know about reciting does this mean our prayers are not acceptable maybe it's about the prayer in the Salah in the prayer you have to say the shahada at the last raka okay so the minimum is the shadow Allah yeah that's a Sunnah so this to say the business the best it's good but it's a Sunnah if you don't do it is valid it's still valid as long as you've washed the minimal Parts yeah so that's just a Sunnah it's not it's not a it's not it doesn't have to happen so you're fine okay so that's what the question is meaning okay no that's very fine okay if someone has acid gas problems and will do breaks during the prayer many times what should he or she do if it's chronic in the Sharia it's called Uh and in that case uh the person just makes will do before they're going to pray and then they pray no matter what happens during the prayer that that is excused if it's something that is continuous that's fine or somebody who has like a bag you know like a urine bag uh it's a form of incontinence so the the the the Sharia is very simple about that just make wudu before you're gonna go pray and then whatever happens happens so you kind of excuse all of those things finally it's actually not finally because there's another question but if a woman wear perfume in public where men are is this sinful what's sinful is that the woman the thing about women and smell and makeup and all of these type of things okay the thing about that is the over the overarching package that's what people don't understand about those Hadith it's not saying that the woman's got to smell nasty that's not what the Hadith means because if a woman smells nasty she will have the same effect on that group of men as if she smells very good which is she's drawing attention to herself but just in the opposite one is positive one is negative that's what people don't understand so the Hadith about women smelling wearing perfume and going out it's about you know taking a shower in your perfume so that you know 10 minutes before you walk in the room we smell you so then then you're like what's that and then you see the sister comes in and you know she's wearing 15 inch heels and all these so it's like we're drawing attention that it's it's the package it's not about so there are ways that women can present that you don't smell it but that just she doesn't smell bad I mean I'm not a woman obviously but I know from the women in my family that there are ways that they do it that's fine so it's about it's about the package it's about the overarching seen public scene and we have to remember that the prophet saws was trying to remind us about the importance of us you know lowering our gaze and being conservative and being modest and respecting everyone's privacy so on and so forth that doesn't mean that we can't interact with one another we have to interact with one another because that's life but it's just how we do it it's the how that's that's what matters there are many opinions about women can't go in public such as they can't go in front of men after doing wudu as it will break and we have to do again can't wear perfume Etc again what I was saying I think one is one companion said something in the presence of Islam about a woman walking in front of a man breaks his wudu like like an animal or like a dog that walks in and she said are you comparing it to dogs now right so uh you know this is the wife of rasulullah no as I said in the shifa class last last week our job as men is to honor and pamper our women the prophet saws that's what he did that's the Sunnah that's the Sunnah he was gentle with with women he loved women uh he had multiple wives he had daughters uh you know all of Adam bate come from his daughter from the lineage of his daughter say the Fatima alaihissalam the prophet saws respected women he said you know be gentle with those who are gentle meaning women the best of you look at this the best of you are those who are best to their women and I am the best of you to my women so he he he put the measure of a man and the measure of worth of who treats their women the best so that means that we have to go out of our way to make sure our women are comfortable and happy and so on and so so this idea that the woman's a piece of trash and she's a piece of Fitness she can't go anywhere that's not Islam I don't know where that came from that's somebody's interpreting warped interpretation and that creates a lot of problems because it creates a lot of tension in families it creates this you know misogynistic thing it creates this patriarchal thing uh so on and so forth so we want to revive the Sunnah on this issue more than anything because it's very important because it's our women who you know will have children raise children and it's investing in them is investing in the Next Generation so on and so forth the prophet saws was not lewd he was not harsh he was not mean he was not crude he you know foreign foreign somebody finds that when they close their eyes it helps them that's okay but when you Allah Akbar and you pray you just you generally just look in the place where you're going to make sujud and that should help you with the concentration what so uh yeah the Shia yeah well the the the shias they pray on that because for them a condition of the prayer and the japati madhab is that your sujud has to be on earth not something that is manufactured like a rug which is so ironic because all the beautiful rugs Are Persian so uh they if they prayed outside they wouldn't pray on that because the Earth is natural sometimes in the janamas that they have they'll just be these rows of clay so the the I think it's they call it they have a name for it the Persian I can't remember the Persian name so this is the the circular Clay is just the the common wave they'll have like a basket of it when you walk into the mosque and they'll they'll like they'll make them from the from karbala yeah yeah but the idea yeah but the idea is that for them the condition of their prayer is that it has to be sujud has to be on earth for us for the Sunni schools that's a Sunnah not not a obligatory part so we can pray here that's fine that's where it comes from tissue because it's not yeah so I'll tell you what we can do if we have shias that can come there's a there's a there's a something that we can do that that hits both sunnis and shias together is that if you have like a straw uh janamas yeah because then that's Earth and then for us that so if you go to mosques in North Africa from Libya all the way to Mauritania most of the mosques that's what's inside they don't have rugs or they'll have the rug and on top of it will be the strong like in a karawin in Fez I mean it's just some all these straw mats so we can have them here it's a soon enough for us and it's that's how we can respect them as well and I wouldn't no I wouldn't because if somebody comes in and sees them they're going to think that this is a Shia mosque so it has a simple thing that I wouldn't do yeah but we can have a janamas that's made out of the straw it's from that's fine that's okay are there any other questions online okay he was [Music] [Music]
