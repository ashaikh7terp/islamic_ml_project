foreign [Music] first of all I would like to apologize to everyone for Last Friday for the miscommunication as I was traveling and I take full responsibility for that miscommunication I apologize that I inconvenienced people some people came to the mosque and many of you are online so my apologies for that but today's session and the next two Friday sessions inshallah will be online okay there are quite a few questions so we'll Jump Right In inshallah eating non-hallal meat on ready-made eateries are these are permissible or not permissive so the issue of eating meats and chickens that is not certified as I've mentioned in the past the overwhelming majority of the alamat say that the meat has to be slaughtered according to the Sharia and that in addition to that involving or including the permissibility of eating kosher food there is a dissenting a good opinion there is a minor opinion that says that as long as a person of the book a Jew or a Christian eats this food then that would make that food permissible now I've mentioned that before the issue with eating Highland food is that it relates to our Dua being accepted so this is not an issue in which one should take a dissenting opinion lightly and this is one of those issues where it's much much better to be more cautious therefore my answer is that no would not be permissible uh unless there is extenuating circumstances or something like that somebody is traveling and they have no access to any other alternative um there's no you know they need some sort of protein and there's no fish option and so on and so forth in that case okay if it's like a one-off thing and one wants to follow the other opinion okay because our other opinion is there however as an ongoing issue I would say absolutely you know you should make the effort to make sure that the food is halal because it impacts your diet if I'm not mistaken either in the last class or the class the last Friday class or the Friday report we talked about this Hadith in sahir now we're going to be talking about this Hadith in the body collection of Imam and so for us living where we live we should make the effort to find certified of the biha and and or kosher this brings up another issue I'm not sure if somebody asked this here or elsewhere but the Testament that somebody saying uh Bismillah in the act of slaughtering amongst the four Sunni schools of law is is a matter of debate so it's not a necessity the Hannity school it's a part a condition for the other schools it's not so that's why we're therefore allowed to eat kosher meat and in this case that is something that burden is not something that is obligatory what matters is that the animal is actually slaughtered the blood is drains on and so forth so that's why we're allowed to eat uh kosher meats and chicken and as I've mentioned before it's available readily available in our area Costco other places Halal markets it's not an issue okay how to address the feeling of you're in the leak in your garment well after washing cleaning and you're about to pray and you're in the midst of Prayer well this could be an issue of what's worse so unless there's something unless there's actual evidence that there's something wet uh you know short of that don't listen don't give in to that type of feeling because that can create a larger problem down the road with following some type you know whisperings the same type of issue happens a lot of times when people make will do and they think I need to wash this part of the body and I think I have to go back and they get into this downward cycle the issue of urine on the body Etc something physical so unless if there's physical evidence that's what we follow we don't follow necessarily I feel uh and in absence of that physical evidence then we are in no need to repeat the prayer it was reciting exercise or recitals during an obligatory prayer permissible especially when you're praying not in a congregation or at home well it's not only permissible it's it's the it's the practice right it's what the prophet saws did the the prophet saws told us to increase our Dua when we are in sujood because this is the closest we are to Allah so the prayer is the time to make the Dua especially in the time you would also many people don't know this but when you're sitting in the shepherd and you finish the Tasha and the Salat on Ibrahim at the end of the prayer before you say I said before you do your salaam at that moment there is an accepted Dua so sometimes some people will prolong that last sitting to accommodate and facilitate the the reading of Dua uh when we pray pleasure prayer and some of them um which is also a Sunnah uh for the Americans and the shepheres uh in time of Crisis we also make the last of our prayer um so on and and so forth so no the Dua in the prayer that's part of the that's what the prayer is made for there's there's something that is encouraged excretion of negis from one's private parts breaks the ablution I know this this includes urine and passing air is it permissible to hold the air being expelled during the entire prayer it's considered disliked to hold either the sensation of having to use the bathroom or to pass wind in order to pray it's just it's considered this life but not not Haram uh the optimal way is to relieve yourself before you pray make will do and pray comfortably but sometimes you know the situation you have to do that and in which case it's just simply just like um I don't know maybe this is part of the previous question but in congregation if I left it will disturb others what should I do if you're in the congregation prayer and you have a feeling that you need to use the bathroom or including passing week and it's not I mean not to get too good not to get too graphic but you know you're able it's not like you're not going to explode with that sensation then you know you can hold yourself and continue the prayer because if you're in our message like if you're in the far end you know by the the office praying or if you're in the women's section you're like in that little glass room all the way the far end man you know it's going to be very disturbing and awkward to leave all of that and walk across the prayer home to the bathroom I understand that so sometimes it's just easier to hold it in there's nothing wrong with that if however you have a sensation that's all you're thinking about you're like dying no in that case I would say leave the prayer you know walk across the prayer Hall to the bathrooms relieve yourself making and come back okay last month during the harappa series regarding the 40 Hadith you mentioned that Muslims selling alcohol to non-muslim than a Muslim country is permissible in the hanafi school that same night we covered the Hadith about shame that if you feel shame doing an act then you shouldn't do it given so this is quite a long question so let me just take the time to read it all out of respect given that many Muslims who do sell alcohol in the U.S Arkansas Alcoholic corner stores or gas stations in other cities and are directly contributing to the deterioration of other black and brown communities to this knowledge itself be enough to prevent Muslims from selling alcohol especially in these communities what's worse is many non-muslims are well aware that Muslims are supposed to or aren't supposed to consume alcohol and this resentment shows up between our communities the idea that you'll sell something that causes disease addiction to our children but don't permit it to your own kids if we're truly working towards solidarity with our neighbors and are trying to be good neighbors you mentioned this at a previous hanapah why would we want to give something horrible to our neighbors that we don't permit for ourselves the existence of of something that is permissible in the Sharia does not equate that that thing is doable and what we what the way we say it is not everything that is permissible is doable it's permissible for a man to marry more than one woman but in most cases it's not doable and in most cases it creates problems how can something that's permissible create a problem well that's the nature of Life the Sharia you know one of my professors uh Professor uh he used to always tell us this you know he would summarize this kind of sentiment beautifully and he would say that Islam has come to deal with the reality of The Human Condition in other words the Sharia is not necessarily here to create an ideal situation but the ideal system of justice and I that that Ideal World that will be in the afterlife but because we are human and we have our idiosyncrasies and we have our weaknesses so on and so forth the Sharia has come to regulate that and that's why you will find things in the Sharia that are permissible but maybe in in many circumstances not doable the way the person that wrote this question asked this question you are painting a narrative that's not doable I I would never say if somebody came to me and said should I open a liquor store in an underprivileged neighborhood selling to under age God would say no of course I shouldn't do that but the ruling that I shared with the permissibility of selling alcohol in non-muslim land for Muslim selling alcohol or you know other things that would be deemed uh impermissible to sell us including Pig and pork products Etc in non-muslim lands shows the flexibility of the Sharia in adapting to certain living conditions for Muslim minority communities so another narrative is that somebody has a restaurant another narrative is that somebody has a grocery store and not in in an underprivileged area so on and so forth I am aware that in parts of America there are this exact scenario Muslims liquor stores in underprivileged areas in which case I would say you know try not to do that or try to get out of that or try to expand because there is also another element which is the element that you mentioned is that the there is the disproportionate harm that is done to in this case African-American uh you know Community the fact of the matter is that the majority the vast majority of Americans or in any Western Country consume alcohol it is considered part of the culture part and parcel of the culture there's no Stigma to it it's legal uh you know in some religions it's part of liturgy in which they take Eucharist and there's I mean it's obviously a little bit of wine but it's wine for us if that's Haram nonetheless a small amount a larger lives Haram to consume so on and so forth so in the hanafi understanding you know this is something that is there is no uh haramness attached to it for the non-muslim so there is no prevention therefore of selling it in that context but remember hanif was not saying go and sell it to people that are being addicted uh that are underproof so on and so forth so when you when you hear me say things like that you have to also understand that this is a ruling of the Sharia this is not necessarily endorsing the act itself or a certain manifestation of the ACT ual is very funny I don't know if I shared this last class or not but I I very recently uh right before I left I I was dealing with a situation a sister who shout out to me in another state um and one of the issues was that her her husband and her husband's family own a convenience store that sells uh alcohol and you know the husband just sort of grew up in that environment not a liquor store but you know a grocery store so you know these things happen uh it happens not just that North America happens throughout Europe Muslim minority communities and European nations Etc so they're they're one must make sure that there's that distinction I work in the bank eight to five and I have no lunch break except that I eat while I work at my desk and have 10 minutes to spare I miss and Juma on Fridays what should I do IM seated in an open public place and have no space to pray and I simply sit at a desk or and another chair and quickly seated although I'm in no way handicapped can I combine Assad and pray you have said yes before for no reason even if I'm not traveling so the the issue with this question is that it depends on what time of the year we're talking if we're in the summer months eight to five would still allow you to to leave work at five and catch the hood and awesome print combining the prayers no problem you can combine those with us in either of the times continue while you work praying four and four records back to that there's nothing wrong with that so if it's in the summer month or let's say it's in a month in which method is uh comes in past 5 PM then you should you could catch the prayer after work both the problem is what you're going to have is when you are in the depths of I think it's maybe uh like December and January I'm not entire maybe that's not entirely accurate but when some I think method of maybe in our area might even be as early as 450-ish 455 something like that in that case you're going to have to excuse yourself from work and pray the four and four in a back office or outside somewhere you know you have you'll have to make that effort you can't pray sitting down when you're physically able to stand again they can be quick eight records it need not take more than five minutes you could recite just the fact in every raka not reciting a second Surah afterwards and the first Turlock to make the prayer shorter I mean there are ways to uh to accommodate that but combine the prayers absolutely and missing Juma is excusable because there's a reason because you are at work but you must make the effort uh in the days in which and they're only going to be I mean a minority of the months in which the days in which the Merit is going to be very early that being said As Americans and in the American workplace they're by law you have the right to to have that accommodated so you should also feel a little bit of strength in being able to self-advocate with respect uh that this is something that's going to take no more than five minutes okay we have presented our young prevented our young son from eating from the school cafeteria or from McDonald's as the food may not be Helen and he is obliged so God bless him but is this Fair as we live in a country which is largely Christian in our believers um well you know first of all acknowledge the the decision that you've taken and no matter what kind of protect your your son and all of our children and uh not only is it is it it's not an issue about Fair it creates character um just I think was just today uh earlier today they're talking about I think the national the U.S national Coast Guard more people are leaving that are being recruited uh I think the Pentagon last month was talking about the difficulty in in finding enough recruits to keep a certain amount of quota in our armed forces and all of this is indicative of the changing uh priority that young people have uh changing understanding a level of non-commitment so on and so forth but being able to go somewhere and having the the self-discipline to say no to have the self-discipline to keep your prayer to have some self-discipline to keep a Halal diet this create this is a great gift that you have given your son it's quite the opposite uh because complacency laziness weakness of character is something that that abounds and it surrounds us and we must we have an obligation you know to to try to teach our children uh to be stronger than that so I wouldn't look at it as an issue excuse me I would look at it as an issue issue of fair or not fair but rather I would look at it as an issue as a teaching moment that you are giving your child the gift of self-restraint because there will be reasons and other aspects of life in which to exercise that self-restraint as they grow older as they enter into the workforce force and they have their own children our own families of their own so it's not just the issue of like oh everyone gets to eat McDonald's and I can't even know first of all we have more than enough uh Alternatives I mean I don't find a problem with that I mean we eat comfortably all the time alhamdulillah at all of our functions at the message the food that we prepare I mean the one thing that the Interfaith Community always comments on is how good the food is that we always have at iccp so obviously it's the balance you know the options are there so don't look at it as from that Vantage Point look at it from another vantage point about character and strength and fortitude we get our meat from a Butchery from a farm which was a has a conveyor belt for Slaughter and a voice recording or a person president besides what is your take this is permissible um and in the Muslim majority world that's what they do uh to accommodate all of the uh 50 opinions so that's fine regarding home mortgages home mortgages and vehicle leases you have said it before but as long as there is an asset between me and the finance here this transaction is permissible can you repeat the opinion please as I have requested others to listen to your opinion today so yeah we'll just assume that the others these other people are somewhere out there uh listening in and the uh the issue with this with this question is that the modern physically understanding of these Financial transactions is that as long as there is a an asset a tangible a car appliances Furniture a house uh land Etc that this is not an issue of borrowing money in exchange for some kind of benefit which is one of the categories of the Hiba transaction but rather that this is a Finance tamui this is a finance transaction and that extra amount or that interest is not considered the river now this has a lot to do with also the changing nature of money itself because money fiat currency paper money is no longer backed by gold and silver the share price the leadership High School the later scholar juries of the chef I might have said that there is no River in money that is not backed by Golden sin because Imam limited the understanding of riba to be something that is intrinsically part of gold and silver only not on the concept of money but on gold and silver so were gold and silver to be used for money over gold and silver used to back a currency then such a transaction will not be permissible but because it that tie has been severed you know for two two three generations now ever since the 1970s uh globally then that that allows this reinterpretation of that type of transaction to be a transaction of finance and therefore permissible this is the official position of the daughter if that the national federal office of Egypt or Bhutan are part of and this is what I gave as a sort of a shorter version of the reason behind it if I get interest in my checking and savings account and I give it away without using it for consumption myself will this be considered Salah Allah's eyes of course this is considered maybe the questioner is also assuming that that interest is the river or Haram and just as I said in the previous question that is not considered but interest is a return on the investment of the money so if you kept it it will also be fine to donate that amount is of course and may Allah continue to bless us for our donations and our giving I have arthritis and a cream which has marijuana as a base has been recommended by my masseur for rubbing on my skin is it permissible from an Islamic point of view if it helps of course it's permissible because the substance of the marijuana is considered pure because it's a plant so if you put that you know on your skin that's not considered putting any najessa on your skin and therefore you could pray and do the things that you need to do um if it makes you high that's another question which would you know um of course the Sharia is very liberal when it comes to Medicine and if there's something that uh that is you know there are there are more potent things that we take for you know pain medicine for example the narcotics that we take oxycodone and things like that I mean that that actually makes you very hard and they're very addictive but sometimes the pain that you have requires that and of course that would be permissible machine yeah so in this case yeah that's fine this is a very minor usage of the marijuana in Morocco the government has permitted growing and exporting marijuana but sometimes I love the questions you guys send me sometimes I I shudder when I read the questions but today this was it's been very enjoyable so far in Morocco the government has permitted growing and the growing and export of marijuana would you know on what basis they made this decision I have no idea about the details of this if I were a guessing man I would say it has something to do with economics uh the hope that it would um raise money so I don't know enough of the um the marijuana industry in Morocco to to give you an informed opinion and I mean drugs obviously it goes without saying or Haram to consume the problem with with drugs uh in the Sharia is that in the case for example marijuana which is you know a plant that we know is that the plant itself the substance is a pure substance it's thought it it's pure like if I had a marijuana plant you know in my shirt pocket I would be able to pray it's not you know it's not how just like if I had tobacco you know in my shirt pocket I could stand and pray because the tobacco as a substance is pure the consumption of these things however is a different story because the effect makes on the body so because of that distinction the Sharia I think that's where sometimes people try to play like this oh well we're growing it for medical purposes okay well if it's for medical purposes uh legitimate medical purposes then okay that would be permissible of course because the medicine that we take has all sorts of stuff in it and that stuff has to come from somewhere um but my experience uh which is limited but I do have some experience and some insight into the to the idea of growing marijuana it's not that I've grown marijuana I mean I looked into it and talked to people Etc is that it's largely an excuse for people to to want to get high and and I I need that with all seriousness in other words there is medical marijuana there is medical applications for marijuana there might be transformative medical applications for marijuana but I have found that the people that claim that they want to do that they're not really doing that um and uh it's really just sort of smoke and mirrors so I would be very I would look at I would look at this as very dubious is what I'm saying whereas mushrooms and psilocybin uh asawaska and these other type of psychedelics there is a growing movement in the medical community to use these type of medicines in in a controlled way to deal with their various disorders post-traumatic stress disorder uh people War veterans Etc now that's I find that that aspect to be more serious than the marijuana aspect but as for the Morocco thing I'm I just don't have an I'll have to look into it and maybe the next time we do this session I'll have something more is it worth reading the Quran if you don't understand the meaning does one get edger by doing so in Allah's name this often goes through my mind I do try to read with meaning but most often I like reading the Quran for Allah's sake I feel good in my own way of course the Quran is and it's magical right every aspect of the Quran is rewarded your your eyes are rewarded by simply looking at the Quran which is why many people decorate their houses with you know like or something like that because even looking at the script of the Quran is a reward holding the Quran is a reward So reading the Quran meaning audibly saying the verses such as that your eyes are seen your mouth is is reciting your ears are hearing but that's all multiple rewards now if you did that and you understood it that would be another added reward so this either or black or white this is one of the problems of the modern mindset this is not the Islamic mindset the mindset of Islam is yes and yeah do that and try to meaning but I can't with meaning okay but still read the Quran as a rule and this is a first principle of Islam never do anything or never engage in anything that will sever your relationship with the Quran bottom line because this is one of you know shaytan's ploys is to try to separate you uh oh I really don't understand it so I'm not gonna so what ends up happening with that mindset is you end up not reading or understanding the Quran at all you just like it just becomes something that's too distant you just put it there on the high level of yourself wrapped in your very nice rapping very you know you respect it or you never open it don't do that that's the the what the prophet saws said is is that the Quran will testify it can be testified for us or against us Allah and testify for us so don't allow yourself to ever be distant from the Quran hold it read it listen to it with meaning without meaning keep going and the more you do it the more you will gain inshallah when what is in when one is doing Salah can one recite two or three short furas for each raka do these surahs have to be in the same order as it appears in the Quran okay so it is a Sunnah to recite part of the Quran after the first two rakas of every prayer so both rakaza Fajr of course and raqqa one and two of all of the other prayers you can recite two surahs you could recite in the same in one raqqa and then continue or you can recite one soon or you can recite because it's a Sunnah do those surahs have to be back to back look let's say hello Akbar I recite the fact and then I say is [Music] and then I go and I say yes an earlier part of the Quran and they're they're not in order there's nothing wrong with that the custom is is that what you recite in the prayer that one follows the other but it's not an obligation you could recite a pseudo from here an infinite or you could even it could even be different than that Allah and then I finish the last verses of uh and I finished that and then I go back my in this case I recited the last three or four verses then I go back [Music] Etc the beginning of Surah nothing is wrong with that it's just the custom is that they would fall that I would recite the verses from bakara first then the verses from through what is not permissible is that I recite the ayat in reverse order so instead of reciting the last three verses of Surah I recite the last verse and then come back and recite the verse before that Etc that's what's not permitted but do the surahs have to be in order no uh do the recitation pieces that you choose to recite have to be in order no this brings up another question what happens if you accidentally recite an extra Surah in raqqa three or four it's it's fine there's no there's there's no prohibition against that but that's not concerned and that's another common question that some people have Etc okay next question is it okay to recite small students during the five-time prayers when in the message I hear them deciding wrong students does it matter I notice when you are there you recite small Shooters and that makes me happy so I know that I'm on the right track because it's not it's it is necessary to learn is is I think not necessarily the longest I'm not an Arabic speaking and find it hard to memorize as well even though I keep trying inshallah um the sun is to make the prayer short if the prayer is in congregation and in the school of Imam it is recommended that the Iman read from the last very last section of the Quran the last eighth of the final Jews which is why it's very common in uh areas in which the Maliki method is dominant you will find the Imam of the prayer usually reading short surahs in addition to its dislike the Malik you might have to recite only part of the Quran in other words the Sunnah for Imam Malik is to recite a whole Surah well obviously you're not going to recite Allah so therefore you're going to recite you know from to the end of the Muslim so this is the practice that I have i i as you mentioned I do myself as the practice of all of my teachers and um the only exception to that practice is when we're praying behind somebody who is known for their exceptional recitation or obviously in the month of Ramadan but in regular prayer somebody who's known for their exceptional recitation memorization and Mastery of the different recitals there are different uh the different clinics in which case you know that kind of outside or something like that yeah it is typical that the recitation would be longer because that person is known as a teacher and this mosque is you know teaching most also is a teaching school and that would be the exception but even still the recitation wouldn't be too long in addition there is a Sunnah of reciting the same you know Surah some of the companions complained about a companion who Read Lost in every prayer so the prophet saws asked them well why don't you ask them why he does that so they asked me why do you always recite and he says what's the testification of Allah's Oneness and I love to to recite that and when the prophet saws heard that he said inform him that Allah loves him so actually one of my teachers every prayer he recites uh almost every prayer I've ever prayed behind them except maybe for pleasure prayer and he recites for us and if you've noticed that's a practice that I do as well I I tend to speak in the same surahs for that reason for that Hadith as well as it's a Sunnah to make the prayer short and sweet as I like to say you know what's the point of um prolonging the prayer when people are distracted when people don't understand you know women have children people are older so on and so forth so that's that's a little bit about that okay during winter prayers I do get up all three times unlike method of Prayer meaning that they don't sit with the Sherwood at the second also on the third record they said that I must recite a Surah afternoon is this correct for the longest time I just recited on the third record but they said that this was not correct that I should recite another student after the federal please clarify um so this is one of the ways of praying with the prayer uh my understanding is that there's no Surah red after that third lookup so this is unfortunately something that I will need to verify and get back I I did not uh I need to I need to consult the 100 resources and get back on this question I apologize in either case it's a minor point because the prayer is valid either way the Sunnah prayers was the Sunnah prayers introduced by the prophet saws can you narrate a little more about this of course that's why they're called Sunnah prayers so uh uh they're called uh the sunnahs of the Prophet saws stuck with the Surah the Sunnah before the part of the prayers and after the part of the prayers the two rockets the four archives after the two Assad the turakas after uh uh that's treacherous too uh and then the six of those that's eight two of us ten another eleven twelve sorry the four rockers before and the foreign and then two workers after I share 16 plus one record of which of is the minimum wage is 17. so the sunless are related in the sharpai method are the 17 extra Lockers in addition to the 17th that's how that's how it's easy to remember uh and then there are other prayers that are also surahs like the Doha prayer which takes place after the sun rises will be of course and the priyam prayer so and so all those prayers were all things of the Prophet did and are meritorious and out of our love and respect for him we follow as much as we can was the prophet saws asked not to preach the religion to others but to spread the Quran to the people so they can learn from the Quran and follow the Quran converting people to Islam by preaching and religion is prohibiting Islam is this correct please clarify so I think this is an issue in which there is a problem with language because people in Arabic you know we call we or Islam in the language of Islamic saying we talk about dawah which we understand and inviting people or sharing about our faith with other people which gets assumed in in the western mindset as the same as proselytizing which is actually going to try to convert people my argument is that Islam is not a proselytizing religion in the western sense and that because simply for the fact that Allah is the one who has given himself only the power of conversion is the one who guides who he Wills not us so therefore we have no there is no human agency in conversion you can't make somebody convert so this idea of Islam being a proselytizing I I think is a gross misunderstanding of the concept of Doubt our way is the way of clarity and Bayern we are here to share we are here to openly invite people to learn if they want but if they don't want to learn then don't learn woman whoever wants let them believe in whoever wants let them not believe doesn't make a difference to us because then you know that's between you and your your lord your prayer and you'll have to face Allah you want to learn about Islam we're here to teach it to you so we're not here to impose we're not here to convert we're not here to um coerce we're not here to force we're here simply to share but we will be public and we will be clear about what we believe in and about what we stand for and so on and so forth so I'm against this idea of dawah being like I'm gonna go door to door and have you heard the good word and things like that you know I don't think that that's what is meant by that one furthermore there's another problem which is that most Muslims are the ones that need the tower today not non-muslims we are the ones that need to remind ourselves of what our faith teaches us so that we can live up to it so we can practice it most that's where the effort needs to happen quite frankly so that's another issue okay I'm a senior I keep passing urine to wear Pampers I am not fit enough to make wudu every time I like to pray and I do and I visit the Moss truth and Congregation of prayer I do so after taking Abu but is my prayer valid as I keep passing urine in my family yeah this is called Salas and uh and if you reach the stage then it is simply enough as long as you protected you know yourself you know by wearing something secure then you just simply make wudu and then you just continue to pray regardless of what happens inshallah you will do is valid your prayers uh before we jumped into this actual session there was a question about organ donation so uh the issue about organ donation is that the majority of bodies have approved organ donation um the I'm a little bit more conservative when it comes to organ donation because the Sharia definition of death is not necessarily the same as the medical clinical definition of death and therefore there could be a situation in which the organs are harvested from the body or taken from the body while the Sharia says that this person is still alive and then therefore the act of taking those organs will in effect cause the death of the person now I know that this is a very minute like point but I personally am not an organ donor and I'm not ashamed to say that uh and this is you know what I teach my children and my family uh I also acknowledge that the majority of physical bodies that are composed of people that are smarter than me and you know more knowledgeable than we allow it um but I'm I more I just I'm more conservative I'll just leave it at that everyone has to make an informed decision now if somebody came to me and told me I'm an organ donor I wouldn't chastise them because it's an issue in which including the clearly many physical bodies are allowing it or a host of reasons but if you ask me my personal opinion when I personally follow my personal practice yeah I don't I'm not an organ donor okay there are a couple of questions on the chat what is your opinion about the controversy in the UK and Imam gave a memorial service to the queen and people saying save the king and the mosque well I mean they're subjects of of the crown if you're in the UK or actually technically if you're in a commonwealth country then you are a subject of the crown uh of course a citizen of the country but you're a subject nonetheless and part of us being Muslims is having allegiance to the head of state uh just like the sahaba did when they went to abyssini and they fought with the najesh in his arm and at that time that we have no evidence that the najeshi had converted his conversion would come later and furthermore there was an agency after that she died that second the judge he wasn't Muslim and the sahaba continued to live there and serve the state so on and so forth so the argument that oh well if he was a Christian he was really a Muslim he doesn't really because I don't know for some reason some people they try to argue that it doesn't matter uh so from that point of view you know if you're a Muslim in the UK yeah you know God saved the king because that's the stability of the nation the head of state so on and so forth if I'm not mistake it's also the anthem of the country so it's also you know part of part of that there's something wrong in the public for some reason about Muslims being law-abiding people Muslims uh supporting the state uh I don't know what it is that people get a nervous reaction and this issue is one of the largest in my opinion one of the largest issues that we're facing today it's almost as if people don't want us to be Law Abiding and our arguing that we should not how could you stop for Allah how could you say God Save the King think about the implications of what you're saying you know immediately after the Queen's death uh was announced immediately in Parliament all of the from the Prime Minister down they all had to swear an oath of allegiance to the to the to the new monarch you you know that's why I spent so many hours watching the stuff because you know it was so intriguing but that's exactly the the oh the the bear that's the oath of allegiance that we have in our own faith tradition you know there's actually it's actually one of the most Islamic things when you think about it is that there has to be that type of Allegiance and when we were kids in school you know I pledge allegiance to the flag the United States of America to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all you know that's a pledge are you saying that you you don't have allegiance to your state you're to your government at the highest level that's a problem because that's not an Islamic and having allegiances in Islamic ideal so um I mean I I can see why it's odd uh for decades you know no one's saying God saved the king of the mosque and all of a sudden this thing happened but it's a shot it's a sign Faith it's a sign of patriotism Muslims are are patriotic people so on and so forth so you know don't see anything wrong with that I think it's just sort of in the natural course of things uh is it allowed to pray if we see spotting after the period not if your period is within 15 days so the longest length of a menstrual cycle in the Sharia is 15 days so let's say you have your period your cycle for three days and you feel like it's over and you make Wilson and you resume prayer and then two prayers later you you see spotting well the period was only three days so therefore that spotting is added to those three days as a cycle so no you would stop praying until the blood ceases complete once you get to 15 days say you're spotting on and off for 15 days one minute after those 15 days the Sharia says that that blood that appears is not the blood from the womb but blood from elsewhere in the body um therefore you make your Wilson you clean yourself and you resume even if they're spotting after that it's called istahada in the sugar how long do we have to wait to start praying if we have a prolonged period okay I I just need to survives what is considered halal meat can we eat meat by the people of the book you can eat meat people by the people meet from the people of the book the Jews and the Christians if the meat is slaughtered foreign because of laziness no there has to be an absence of water or an absence or an inability to use the water for the um to take place [Music] so if you're traveling or if you're sick if you're in a state of Geneva and you don't find water then perform the time of Allah says so there has to be that condition that there's the absence of water or I'm sick and I can't use the water because I'm just too sick then I can make tamum or there is water but there's only enough for us to drink not for us to also make wudu then I can make payment Etc is organ donation are 10 pounds permissible and I believe the tampons are permissible inshallah what if the Hindu leaders died in my home state this week in India this leader supported Muslims many times so people posted in that in any way but our local Imam who was not a move to suggested that we should not recite non-muslim what is a reminder of death it's not praying for the deceased it's you remembering death so um and any Calamity Calamity performs them uh when a Calamity befalls them they say to Allah we belonging to him in return so no there's nothing wrong with saying the issue would have been if we start making Dua I mean Allah forgive him you know the Dua that we do for like the deceased that's where the the issue or the controversy is but you know my neighbor died John died what happened honorable John could have been Muslim you know what I'm saying um so there's nothing wrong with that because that's a reminder of death can we use perfume that has whoa sorry can we use perfume that has alcohol uh I thought we had this question last time but yes because the alcohol that's used in the perfume is not meant for consumption um so some of the mufties of the different method say that therefore it is permissible uh and this is an opinion that we follow uh how would you recommend finding a spouse is there anything at iccp that helps young people with this issue yes what we have our youth circles and Gatherings that remember so effectively uh put together and and runs and um I mean it's not meant for matchmaking of course but it's meant for matchmaking I mean right I mean this is where these are this is where you're going to find like-minded people with same values and same principles you know they're not issues of overtly matchmaking but if you think about it you know all of our things our matchmaking opportunities I would say so yes alhamdulillah we we have that as you know at our mosque um you know we're we're a big family uh and we love to socialize and after the prayer especially on Fridays you know we're out you know having a bite having an ice cream you know talking with one another and these are the opportunities that I think that people can get to to know one another but specifically this the youth circles are what I I suggest and if you find somebody that's of interest you know reach out to immemorative or reach out to me and then maybe we can help you know kind of take things to the next two or three steps uh there's no shame in that I mean that's that's how it's going to happen right uh it's better that it happens that way than it happens other ways so being a part of the community coming to the events hanging out uh this is also very important and we also such as reminding me that we also have a marriage connection link uh is this online yes it's online so on the website there's a link where girls only girls are registered and that will uh you can read about that on the on the website as a service that we provide okay this is what I think is the last question can you explain the Islamic view of perfume for females outside of the house so anything that a woman does outside of the house to overtly draw unnecessary attention to herself is something that is prohibited whether it be and how she speaks whether it be in how she dresses whether it be and how she walks so on and so forth so the the the Hadith about the woman going outside of the house with perfume is about that it's not about that the woman needs to go out of the house smelling nasty because that will have as a matter of fact the same effect but just in a negative way it will draw unnecessary attention so it's about how the perfume is applied um that it's not applied too much that it's applied to certain parts of the body that it's sprayed and that she walks through it you know other things I'm not a connoisseur of perfume but I mean there's a gazillion ways that that can happen but it's a way it's a way to remind ourselves of our understanding and our interpretation and our application of modesty so I mean that's that's what that's how I would think about those traditions are there any other questions anybody want to ask anything else well martial law we have quite a few people today online I think there might be more people now than were in the beginning so I want to just take this opportunity again to apologize to everybody for the miscommunication last Friday I take full responsibility for that miscommunication I was traveling at the time I was unable I was in a place where I was unable to to to log in um and I should have confirmed and doubled and triple confirmed with everyone that I was not going to be so I apologize for people that came to the mosque and I'm very sorry for people that signed on online I hope I didn't cause any inconvenience for anyone uh but today's session and the next two Fridays inshallah will be online I will be with you even though it's now it's 2 30 in the morning there's nothing I'd like to do at one to two in the morning other than be with iccp so I'm happy to to do that uh and um you know I beg your forgiveness for that for that mishap oh there are more questions uh a brother Tariq uh this is I need to apologize we should express our apology to youthful keep uh thank you so very much for your commitment it's early morning it's the hajjad for you it's not only your a very important questions thank you sir well I mean I was I was fast asleep so I wasn't I was just so upset when I woke up and I saw the text messages anyway there's just two more questions what should you ask someone before you get married um so I wrote us a small article um about this uh to celebrate my 20th anniversary with my wife which I can't remember the night the title of the article but I think it's something about celebrating 20 years of marriage it's on my website um it's one of the more recent articles so you can easily find that I tried to enumerate what I think worked for us for these last 20 years of course all of this is with Allah's permission it is but you know some of the things that I think that are important for you to understand is the prophet saws there are two Hadith but the prophet saws talked about one addressed to women and one addressed to men in regards to marriage when the prophet saws addressed his talk to men and by the way uh two or three Fridays ago my football is on this so that's also on the iccp website maybe that's easier you should find that the prophet saws that a woman is married for four reasons Lee gem Ali have for her beauty have for her lineage uh for her wealth iniha and for her Deen is married a person with Dean and you will be successful and he says almost the same thing to women he said whoever comes to you and you like his Dean and his character than marrying so the issue is about Dean so the question is what is that D what does Dean mean is it means that the person prays five times a day and fast Ramadan obviously that's part of the Deen right we have to do those things but it's more than that it's about somebody's set of first principles and character so what you're looking for is you're looking for somebody who shares the same first principles as you the same who shares the same values as you because those values and those principles are what are well what determine what decisions you make in life so if God forbid something happens a Calamity or or or an important decision needs to be made you will find yourselves more or less on the same page because you have the same values you you honor the same Traditions that's what's in addition to practicing them in in by practicing the faith so the set of questions that you need to ask are are those questions that will bring out in in the answers what are those persons values and what are those persons uh morals and virtues in addition to their character if it's a woman that's that's looking or a man that's looking you need to find somebody that has good character uh good characters that they're courteous uh you know they're you know they're not whatever you know all of the things that we know that would that that person is a refined person of character because you're gonna have to live with this person and therefore you have to be able to tolerate this person and they need to tolerate you you need to tolerate them so character is important so I find that a lot of the questions that people are asking are very material in nature where do you see yourself in five years you know what kind of job do you want you know that it's very it's very quantitative uh if if we've learned anything from from what we experienced the last two years of covert it should be that you can't you can't map these things out it's just you know things happen all the time so uh where I see myself in five years you know living in Beverly Hills driving a Ferrari but probably that's not going to happen because I'm not on you know so those type of material questions for me indicate that people are looking for the wrong thing they're looking for some kind of material guarantee in their marriage and therefore they're approaching marriage as if it's like a business transaction or an investment of money and many times they'll even use that type of I met somebody once who said that a woman he was talking to a girl for marriage and she was a lawyer and she said that I make x amount of money per year and if we're going to have children and I'm not going to um I have to stop working for like a year let's say for the child birth and early months you know rearing process I need you to compensate the Lost income that I'm gonna lose by having this child which is you know for a lawyer that's working at a at a decent firm is a lot of money that's that's the the dumbest thing I have ever one of the dumbest things I've ever heard it turns out they didn't get married or it turns out subhanallah that she lost her job subsequently and for many many years was jobless so when you ask those kind of questions or you think like that about marriage you're going down the wrong path that's not that's not what's going to help you in your marriage what's going to help you are the values and those first principles and maybe we need to have another a separate function just on the marriage thing maybe I can talk to amendment of Ferry and maybe at the end of the month or sometime before Thanksgiving we can do something because there's a lot more that I want to say but now is not the foreign for it can you recite the prayer aloud when we are alone well if you're praying alone it needs to be audible to you like we need to be able to you have to sound them out it's not you you can't just sit there with your with your lips closed and you're reciting in your ear you actually have to form the letters and let the sound come out but just enough so that you can hear them if it's you can be louder okay and then this is the last question last last question can you ask if a man smokes not to judge if they do just because it isn't something that the woman does well you will probably know if the person smokes or not I think it becomes clear but yes you can ask uh but I wouldn't I wouldn't use that as a Make It or Break It situation because I mean I don't want to get too specific but I mean you know are they like a casual smoker or are they you know a chain smoker or you know are they smoking five packs of cigarettes a day okay that's a problem or do they smoke occasionally like you know hookah or something like that it's like a social type of thing that's something else completely so you have the right to ask I mean if you're going to get married you have the right that's the time that you have to ask those difficult questions uh but I wouldn't lead with that question I would lead with the type of first principles value um Dean related questions I just mentioned earlier okay I'm reminded that tonight we also want to make a special Dwight for e-memorative Aunt uh who was on life support until yesterday um and her situation is very clear I did not know about that so I um if you remember if I was doing this or not or or his wife or Not that we're making Dua for remembrance wife uh Aunt sorry and uh indeed it memorized entire family um who has been uh you know a stalwart um uh colleague and and and and and friend and um a tremendous support for our growing iccp family and um you know much loved by by all of us so we're asking Allah tonight specifically to to help his aunt and her time uh his aunt in her time of need and to to be with Imam America's entire family inshallah may Allah protect them and continue to bestow His blessings upon them inshallah I believe this is the last the end of the session um thank you for the questions I hope I got to everything I think there's one question I need to verify the wicked one I will do that inshallah for the next time uh and if I forget please remind me and having concluded we ask Allah to accept from us uh this session may we continue to learn and to grow together um [Music] foreign
