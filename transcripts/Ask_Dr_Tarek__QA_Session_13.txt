i have a list of about 25 questions so i think this will take up most of the time if there are other questions that come in or something's not clear you can ask in the chat but i think the time will be occupied with the question so the first question is given surging rates by the way these questions are all anonymous i don't know who's asked these questions and they've been compiled for me given surging rates of omnicron variant is it thought obligatory these days to attend jerome of prayer assuming mass are required this is more a subjective thing if people don't feel safe or people are high risk or people have underlying conditions or people are not vaccinated or not boosted and you don't feel safe if you don't have an obligation to come to jumba you can praise god at home the mosque however will remain open of course and we continue to take our precautions with social distancing with prayer time mass requirement vaccine requirement etc but if you personally don't feel safe then you have the right not to come to drama and to pray but keep in mind that as the mosque we are doing everything you know cleaning the mosque sanitizing so on and so forth but if you don't feel safe you don't have to come just like if you didn't if you wouldn't feel safe if there was a storm outside maybe one person doesn't feel safe driving in the storm but another person feels comfortable so there's a level of subjectivity to it but if you don't feel safe that is the shadia criteria to allow you not to have to come to the mosque and uh could pray instead [Music] pornography is a major problem that is on the rise in both muslim and non-muslim communities could you please address how this practice can be harmful not only for those seeking to get married but also for those already married it is a problem as the questioner has mentioned i've actually had a little bit of experience dealing with it in some couples therapy um so the question is right to mention people that are married and unmarried and i mean i don't know what i'm supposed to say about it although it is a problem and one of the problems of it or i think there are two major problems or three major problems to it number one is that it projects a false reality um so people that are consumed by pornography and of course pornography it's like saying drugs there's a lot of different types of drugs a lot of different types of pornography so of course we're making blanket statements but it projects a false sense of reality a false sense in this case of the reality of the intimate relation between people and that false reality can end up messing up actual intimate relationships in the future for people and it has distorted marriages and for that reason another second problem with it is that it's addictive so there's a rush of dopamine that happens with it and it becomes addictive people can end up spending hours and hours and hours on it numbing them to the effects of it and number three is that there is a relationship between pornography and violence whether it be violence in intimacy or in the intimate relationship and there have been some studies i know that sheikh hamza was very into this specific aspect of the link between extremism violent extremism and pornography and i think there are some studies that demonstrate that there's a high usage a high viewership of pornography so these three things are that come to mind are three of the larger the larger problems another challenge with pornography is that it is becoming more normalized and uh you find in advertisement suggestions of pornography yeah you find it in mainstream viewership mainstream streaming platforms different shades of it even if it's on the softer side of product on the parameters you still find it nonetheless so it's becoming more normal and that's really the challenge is it's sort of kind of it's kind of caving in on all of us and we have to remember that we have an obligation to lower our gaze this is there's a question here later that we'll come about lowering the gaze but this is an issue that we need to lower the gaze at and that's something that we want to try to prevent ourselves from viewing because when it comes inside it has deep deep spiritual negative spiritual impact um and you know nothing is is beyond fixing but it can have great impact negative impact for both men and women okay for a woman who was unable to pass through ramadan due to pregnancy or breastfeeding what are her options for making up for fasting i know there is an option to donate but how does she know how much to do if a woman is pregnant or nursing a young child this takes the ruling of a person who is sick a temporary sickness meaning that there is a temporary uh reason why she would break her fast and whether it's because she's worried about her own self for her well-being or the well-being of the child there are different opinions but the feeling that we give the fedora based on is that for every day that you miss you have to make up that day so you don't have to worry about the expiation meaning pain there are other there are other opinions that say you have to pay but forget about that right now the simple opinion to make it simple for everyone is that if you make miss a day because you're pregnant just like you if you miss a day because you have your mental cycle or you miss a day because of feeding breastfeeding whatever whatever those days are you have to make up eventually the idea of paying instead of fasting or making up the making of the day is in cases where you cannot fast which means that the sickness is permanent uh god forbid uh sometimes people are too old to fast for example or people have uh medical medical conditions that preclude them from fasting in general in those cases they're going to pay next patient but something like pregnancy or breastfeeding it's something temporary so you make up the day that you miss just like if you are a man and if you are sick or traveling and you miss the day you will make up the day okay while performing ablution starting from hand to mouth nose space sometimes i go to wash my feet forgetting to wash the arms and then remember that i have not wiped the head and clean the ears how about you start illusion from the beginning yes i mean there are different opinions about the order but most of the opinions the positions are that the order is an obligation so if you have a problem with the order of we do and it's a constant problem then what you can do is you can start by making the bare minimum until that problem goes away which is to wash your face and then to wash your right arm your left arm your head and then your right foot and your left foot that's it don't do the other things by minimizing and cutting out the sudden axe it might be easier for you to remember the order so again that would be the face the right arm the hand and after the elbow the left the head the right foot at the left foot up to the ankle thank you okay following the recent successful heart transplant in the pink heart performed by a muslim surgeon i would like to know how muslim scholars in the shitty are like in will approach this event for a long time now pig valves are used to replace damage valves in the ear in the shadia specifically in the shatter method you are allowed to use in impure substances for medical purposes um so this is actually an easy one uh the pig is obviously universally cons or not university but in the three main schools of sunni islam is considered necessarily with the exception of the manikin which considers all all animals to be pure but all muslims regardless of the school of thought or their uh agree that the pig is impermissible to eat and to consume obviously but in the case of medical medicine the shadia is very liberal so whether it be medicines that intoxicate whether it be medicines that have uh ritually and then mages in it richly pure all of those things would be considered permissible in the case of medicine especially if there are no other substances or no other alternatives that would be okay i don't know if this is a case in which there are no other alternatives so that's something that pollutes me i forgot to look into that but if there are no other alternatives then there's nothing wrong with that this is based on the hadith of drinking the urine of the cow for medical purposes so the shepherds take that hadith as a principle that in cases of medicine because the urine is considered dementia is considered richly impure so in cases of medicine racially impure digestion is allowed [Music] you know is it compulsory for women to cover the head when reciting the quran no the prophet saws used to recite the quran a big victory in all his circumstances except if he was in a state of major ritual impurity geneva but other than that there is no nothing should preclude you from reading the quran if a woman is by herself or if she's at home or she's amongst other women she doesn't have to cover now some women cover when they read the quran out of honoring that this is the book of allah this is the quran and that's that's fine that's a that's a noble practice but it's not a condition in some books in classical books and some you'll read stuff like that you'll read for example that you shouldn't go into the bathroom unless your head is covered it's not a sunnah it's just a practice because then the bathrooms were usually places that were filthy and i've said this before our modern bathrooms are more luxurious than the palaces of caesar [Music] the modern bathroom has completely changed so those type of things were out of caution out of general uh uh what was considered proprietary but it's not a it's not a condition you'll read in the books for example you can't accept a testimony from a man whose head is not covered that's because at that time there was no no man no it would go out in a muslim majority [Music] area but that doesn't mean now if you don't have your head covered you can't accept somebody's testimony because it's not considered normal so sometimes these things change this is one of those issues which it's not a condition but people will have written about it as a way of honoring the book of allah when one recites the quran can one have intentions of dedicating to someone who has passed away parents or child some say it's not permissible don't pay attention to the people that say it's not permissible because they're wrong because reciting the quran with the intention of donating or dedicating the reward of that recitation to the person is something that is firmly established where is it firmly established because we can make hajj for people who have passed away the hajj everything is included in the hajj the hajj includes recitation of the quran it includes fasting it includes co-op it could include everything in the hatch when you do the hajj for example for a parent or a grandparent or somebody and you dedicate the reward of the hajj to that person so whenever all of it goes its individual parts go with the exception of the prayer because allah says the prayer is a specifically a sign act for the person so we cannot make up prayers for people who have passed because the prayer is something that allah says is linked to us individually but everything else fasting reading quran charity tawaf sai the jamaa all of these things in all you can do that with the intention that that reward goes to the deceased so the people that say that this is not permissible the problem with this mentality is that they believe maybe they have an acknowledgement but they believe that death is the end of life that's the problem death is not the end of life death is moving from one form of life to another form of life if you believe that death is there's nobody there that's when you start saying it's haram to go to visit the saints it's haram to go to the graveyard it's haram to do this how to do that because in the back of your mind you're saying there's nothing there but we know that that's not true what if that were true why do we wash the body shroud the body pray over the body in the message and then go bury the body why don't we just throw it in the street or burn it because there's still a body there there's still life right isn't there a body still there okay maybe the soul has left the body but there's still body there why do we do the talking and we talk to the dead person in the grave and say the angels are going to come why would we talk to the dead person of the person he's not there so the the problem with this the sadafi thing is that they don't understand death or life for that matter please please clarify the differences between zakah and sadaqah in simple form zakaya is a specific act of worship that has specific conditions that when you have excess liquid wealth above a certain amount that amount is called the nassau that you donate or you have to give two point five percent of that to one or more of the eight categories as i can mention that's what zak is charity is anything that you do outside of that whether you give money outside of that or whether you donate your time or whether you donate clothes or you donate a service or you're just doing something that's charitable that's outside of that specific setup so charity is much much broader than zakah you might not be a person that has any wealth that necessitates that care but still you give money that would be considered charity so zachary think of it like prayer the prayer time has to come in you have to have wudu you have to face mecca the place has to be clean you have to do all of the rakaats then you check your prayer that's like zakker is you just walk into the mosque and you just pray to ragas but just for the sake of it that's like suddenly you just give for the sake of it so that's the difference between the two if you have excess liquid wealth above that you saw one year has passed one lunar year has passed you have complete access control and minted 10 of that money then you're going to give 2.5 to one of the one or more of those categories in uh that is the zeke of course if you have livestock i mean none of you have livestock but i know if you have livestock in your backyard somewhere they could use that cat on that you also probably will get in trouble with the county but there is a cab for livestock as well there's account gold and silver there's this account on trade goods for those of you who trade but i just say liquid money because that's usually what we face account principles so i i buy um green coffee and i sell green coffee but if that's trade kijara but if i buy green coffee and i roast it and i package i've altered it that's not the trade that's industry something else so the trade is when you buy and sell the same item then at the end of the year you'll have to take stock of the inventory and with certain conditions it pays again for traders but not for people that are processing the material you might buy individual raw material but you're processing them for example there's no that's not there's no cameras because it could be counting issues right you have it for the full year the full year and it has to be above when you solve so how would you calculate that for example so how would you calculate [Music] find you for selling bad gas i know you yeah you probably put water in there too in the water no no because you're always replenishing them so then there's no year so you lose that one condition of the having the whole year thank you for having me [Laughter] okay by the way if i haven't said this week everyone needs to donate to iccp everyone online please are we online what's that screening are you sure i forgot to mention people need to donate to the message i'll make this message again on friday actually maybe i can stop asking answering the questions okay also if one wants to give something in remembrance of a person who has passed away does this constitute sadhaka yes the prophet saws said that when you pass away your hesed your scale of deeds stops except for three things if you knowledge that you left behind or some sadaqa some charity that you've engaged with that keeps on going that prays for you now that that person doesn't have to be your blood relative it could be the community which you may want for the deceased so anything that you do for the deceased is going to go to the deceased inshallah so for those of you for example who have parents who have passed away it's always a good habit that when you donate money or when you feed somebody like in ramadan you always include your parents in that knee and that intention as a habit as a practice to always be giving back to your parents if one wants to give something in remembrance of the person who was passed away does this constitute a son yeah and so we donate these clothes and i want you know i'm doing this for my for my grandmother i'm doing this for my parents of course why not can i hang pictures of my relatives in the house pictures are not haram the the picture the photograph the picture or image that from the phones is not the surah that is talked about in the hadith as a matter of fact referring to these pictures or photographs as a surah in the arabic language is a mistranslation this is one of the problems why many people still think that pictures are haram because there are hadith to talk about the surah being haram the surah of the hadith is a three-dimensional statue image made with the purpose of worship the photograph is not that the photograph is something completely different so the photographs are not haram and shiv who was the grand movie of egypt in the 1920s he wrote a little book called the clear answer to the permissibility of photographs and he and he demonstrates the argument sort of what i'm talking about so this is one of the um laments of miss the the problems of translation or modern arabic we in modern arabic we refer if somebody had like a picture of their own picture but that's not the another worship have been used for that because the surah in the in the language of the arabs means something else what is haram is if you have a statue that you have for worship uh that is i mean obviously that's like a statue like david or like the statue of nike or one of these like you know famous statues we're not gonna put that in our house but even if you inherited something like that you wouldn't destroy it right because this world heritage so you donated to a museum or something like that so don't get any wild ideas and we coexist with the haram too that's also another concept that we forget about so just because in many muslim countries or muslim majority cities you'll find statues and busts and stuff like that so even though that might technically be arguable that it's haram from the sharia point of view we don't go and destroy public property because there's this concept of co-existing with the haram remember that the prophet saws existed with the idols in the kaaba until the last year of his prophecy when he conquered mecca and then he removed the idols but all throughout his prophecy he prayed to the kaaba even though there were 360 idols inside and outside he was praying to the idols right but he was coexisting with it until the opportunity came for him to remove foreign as an example to all of the believers the wife of pharaoh who asked allah subhanahu ta'ala to save her from firaoun to build her a place in paradise and we give as an example to all the believers mary the mother of christ so on and so forth ibrahim says that these women were prophets and moses and we have revealed to the mother-in-law that allah uses the same word why revelation now the others they say yeah and he kind of inspired the mother of moses because if it hasn't read it you know literally allah says he could have used another word he said well i'll highlight when she was experiencing uh the pains of labor to shake the palm trees the daytree so ibrahim says that these references mean that these women were prophets so it's a difference of opinion so follow the opinion that says that these women are prophets and then you'll know that allah has mentioned in the quran and has given them as an example for all believers concerns that come up with the imams who refuse to do neca of a non-muslim male to a muslim woman this has become a major issue i read in the washington post as well is the fifth council of north america looking into this what are your thoughts about this it also mentioned that the non-muslim men were practicing the religions as well fasting and sometimes as well that the imams would not agree to consummate the marriage if we want to propagate the religion in the u.s these constraints will be disadvantaged to muslims first of all we don't want to propagate islam that's also we just want to practice islam propagating this time this happens who you want who we want but allah guys so this i we are not a propagating faith we are not a proselytizing faith evangelical christians buddhists they they proselytize mormons not us that's a misconception and that type of proselytizing i would argue me as dark i would argue is completely anti-semitic we need to practice our faith and if people want to learn about it we can teach them about it and we want to get involved in the public domain and issues that concern all community and we want to add to the conversation yeah that's that's fine but whether somebody wants to believe a muslim whether or not someone wants to believe in islam or not that's not our business so the idea that we want to propagate or that's really not our issue at all the issue of marriage in islam or the issue of marriage in general is always in religion something that is related to the divine it has nothing to do with our understanding it is always a function of religion and all religions in their orthodox expressions they all don't allow cross-marriage across religious marriages except people that change their religion that's that that happens all the time but we don't we're not allowed to change our religion right and we alhamdulillah we have not and will not so this is not an issue of there's something to look into it's it's not permissible all muslim medicine all the muslims of the past the muslims of the present muslims of the east the muslim to the west the muslims of the north and muslims every single muslim is in agreement on this issue that there is not permissible for a muslim woman to marry outside them faith or for a muslim man for that marriage outside of the faith except in certain specific instances with a certain type of christianity or judaism that's it even even outside of those two faiths even though we argue that the concept of people of the book adam kitab is larger than jews and christians even in that case it's not promised no one has ever said it's permissible for a muslim man to marry uh zarason for example or for a buddhist or hindu or something like that so this is not an issue of it doesn't sound cool we need to rethink it there's some things that we can't rethink because that's how the religion is this is from the text of the quran all religions are like this orthodox religions that is and it's just an issue of israel of consensus there's nothing that we can do about it um and there's no rational reason why by the way some other men will say oh because the children follow the religion of the man that's also not a real explanation there's no no if someone yeah but that's all the questions the question is about a muslim woman marrying outside of the faith you know if somebody says the shahada then that counts these rational explanations that you read about also are not real explanations maybe in some scenario the children follow the religion of the jews aren't the opposite argument they say that the children follow the religion of the woman which is why judaism is passed on through the women not through the male for example so just because you just because the people before us try to articulate these things doesn't mean that all of their articulations necessarily made sense the real answer is allah says it's universally understood it's an issue of consensus between sunnis and everyone one of those issues that we all agree on and it is what it is okay but as moore said if somebody says the shahada the shadow counts uh that's people are married what do you mean yeah yeah exactly exactly now what happens if you find people that are she does it anyway she gets married you know they have kids it becomes another another problem i'm not gonna answer that question but i state the question maybe next month if you talk about that okay what does bina and fitna mean where does one draw the line when when both the quran and sun are silent and then some of our mosques are confronted by the haram police and young people are turned off but there's a lot going on in that question so first of all there should be no haram police so if there are people in in different mosques who go around pointing out all the haram people then we should ask them politely to go to another mosque because you know that's not that's not the way of islam that's not the way and if there are all of that or there's an imam or there's somebody who's been given that task that's different then they can help guide the community but people going around oh your prayer was wrong when you're fasting that's that's not the way of islam that's not the way of the setup so we don't want that we don't want the police or the police for that matter but we want a you know safe environment where we can worship and we can be inspired so on and so forth um because not only are young people turned off but people in general are turned off and we've mentioned this before that many many people are unlost you know in this country many many people don't even go to the mosque at all haven't you noticed that we are the same people that always show up the same few people so there are most people don't want to come to the masjid so this is one of the reasons why because they don't feel safe coming and if you don't feel safe coming then we have failed so that's a big big problem people should be welcome to come so on and so forth what is what is the difference between biddah and fitment a fitment is some type of social you know upheaval or calamity or a potential con you know controversy that can lead to division through the community that's what a fitness is it could be as simple as um you know i come to leave the mosque and i don't find my shoes and you know i next week i see some other brother wearing my shoes and i accuse him of stealing them so we've created this you know fitness and someone said some people will be on my side and then something will be on the other side and something will leave all together because the smallest they want to be a part of it that's like a fitna or they're the big fitness which end up becoming warfare and nations fighting against one another conflict okay allah says and another verse he says he says that fitna this type of of social upheaval is worse than manslaughter it's worse than killing somebody that's how bad divisiveness is and i was thinking about this the other day i don't know why but i was thinking about this vis-a-vis the civil war an american civil war and i concluded that that was the the crime of the civil war that the crime the major crime of the civil war was not slavery or it was not states rights over the federal federal rights it was it was splitting the union and that's what allah says that's how bad it is to split the community that was the crime of the confederacy or that's the crime of the civil war is that splitting the union of the nation so somebody killing somebody in cold blood is less of a problem than fitna and that's why we have to you know stay away from fitness as much as humanly possible if we sense it or we feel it in the community not to add to it is something different a bidder is something that is new that is done and the bidding islam falls under one of the five categories of the rulings of the shadia either the vida is necessary or the bidder is recommended or the buddha is permissible or the bidder is disliked or the bidder is haram and there are examples so for example the quran that we have this is a buddha that was necessary the sahaba the prophet did not order the companions to put the quran in one volume and write it out but there was a necessity if we didn't have that we would have lost the quran that's a vida that became recommended so it's assumed from the time of the sahaba up until our time we pray that we have prayer in the month of ramadan expanding the mosque it's a buddha that we need have we don't have it but the mosque for the imam prays that's a bitter there was no maharaja at the time depends what it the act is okay so that's what a beta is but how come in the football we say uh or missed guidance and all misguidances in the hellfire it means all this guidance that is not based on principles of the quran and sunnah the prophet saws whoever invents something in this religion of ours that is not from it then it is rejected but if it is from it if it's based on a principle so the vida is something that is new a newly invented manner and it falls under one of the five categories of the shiriya something in islam that is not from islam then it is rejected but if it is from something from islam then it's accepted and that's why we have some data that we've accepted and that we have to have so on and so forth so that's the difference between bidad and fitna the thing about the haram police most people that go around saying or your prayer is wrong most people that do that usually have the least amount of knowledge in my experience because when you start to study islam and you start to study the sharia qurans and all of that you start to realize how wide it is and how plural it is and how flexible it is and we saw our teachers who you know we consider our authority figures and you know the likes of which we'll never see ever again so on and so forth hardly criticize people or hardly point out anything we've lived like that that's what we how we're interacting with them because they always find a way out for the person or another opinion so on and so forth that's the way of the senate the way of the setup is to be easy with these things and only to point out something if you know absolutely that it's wrong or if you've been placed in a position in the community to point out those things but we're not here to judge one another or to point things out and it happens all the time and for some reason it happens to sisters more than happens to men i don't know why and my daughter had a recent incident like that in egypt actually in medina somebody told her or hijab was not right or something like that so i mean it happens it's going to continue to happen but it's wrong is it bad to stand and drink a glass of water no it's not bad or haram but the sun is to drink sitting but it doesn't mean that you can't drink standing up my son is left-handed and he likes to eat with the fingers of his left hand is this bad he gets mad when i correct him burden the soul except what it can bear if you're left-handed and that's your dominant hand then it's okay if you can't eat when you're right you might mess up your the food and the drink and spill it everywhere created you that way the sun is to eat with the right when the right by itself is engaged so i want to go grab a sip of this i grab it with my right hand but because i'm holding this pen or maybe i'm on the phone so if i was like this and i took a sip that wouldn't be haram because both hands are engaged that's the hadoop that's narrated people don't realize that the the hadith about eating with the right means only with the right hand is engaged but if both hands are engaged in the process of eating then the prophet has an eight with both the left and the right so for example if you have a fork and knife and you're eating western style with the fork is in the left and you're cutting with the right and then you eat both hands are engaged that's that's sunnah because that's how the prophet saws and eight when both hands were engaged that's just an aside but as far as the questioner if the child is left-handed there's nothing wrong with meeting with your left hand now your kind of belongs the eating and the grooming physical grooming these are all things that are are from the from the sun so following the sun is going to be better than not following the sunlight but it doesn't mean not following the sun in these cases is necessarily how can women go to the burial ground where the burial takes place yes this is an example of abrogation in the sunnah the prophet saws i used to forbid you from attending or from visiting the graves now i say visit the graves okay so this is an example when we teach this is an example of abrogation nest in the sunnah where the prophet saws used to forbid uh women from visiting the graves and then he said no now you should go visit because it is a great reminder so there's nothing wrong with that can male or female view the body of a deceased after the shrouding is done in some cultures they say this is bad for the soul of the deceased well when we shroud the body we cover the we shroud above the head and then below the feet so you mean the shrouded body there's nothing wrong with seeing that because you bring the body to the mosque to pray uh if you if if you mean like viewing like the face which is not an islamic practice but it's a western practice it's not haram but it's not our way it's not our sunnah is to shroud the entire body uh if it's looking at the naked body the the aura of the of the body has to be covered men cannot wash women and women cannot wash men even if it's your spouse this is an issue of agreement amongst but this is contrary to all evidence and all of the medicine so we don't allow that and maybe there was a special circumstance in that case for washing but but the same gender wash and shroud the body uh but seeing the body in the way that i mentioned there's nothing wrong with that but the body should be covered the face should be covered because you take the shroud and you take it above that you it's not an issue allowed i wouldn't do it because it's not that's not what we do the the way we honor the deceased is to wash shroud pray and vary as quickly as possible which is an issue that this could this could introduce this is a buddha this would be a reprehensible video we don't do that i mean the body is we're here to honor we have an obligation a communal obligation to take care of this person until we put them into the ground do the tongue clean and bury them properly so we don't want to do anything that will delay that or all of those things are for the living not for the deceased but our teaching is to honor the person that has been deceived so we don't wait like if somebody dies uh we bury them even if the family all the family member hasn't congregated you know maybe they're in other countries they're coming where they're stuck we don't wait we because we're honoring the person who has died not waiting for the family member this so i mean not that i know but i would do that at the place where the body is washed i think by the time we come to the message to do the janeza prayer i think it's too late for that that's fine but you know once you once we do the caffeine and we shroud the body then we shrouded the body we're beyond that it's bad for the soul i mean i don't know uh hadith or a tradition that says that but i would just say that i wouldn't encourage by the time we come to the mosque to do the genes i wouldn't encourage them what matters the most is praying the jedness of prayer as many rows as possible which is a sunnah that most people don't do that's also something that's what's important for the deceased and i think if family members get emotional and upset which is understandable it happens i think we need to remind the family members that we're doing the score the honor of the person who has died can a woman lead a recitation or nasheed in a gathering of men and women in indonesia women recite beautifully in some shapes get very upset and say this is haram the voice of the woman is not an aura and there's no proof for that the other night that say that the voice of the woman is an aura it's a deduction because they argue that the entire body of the woman is tower so we'll just throw the voice in there with it but there's no evidence there's no standalone evidence that the voice of the woman is an hour as a matter of fact the other man that saved the entire body of the woman is the hour you ask them why do you say that the voices [Music] and if you go to ask them then ask them from behind a barrier which is a proof against them because you're going to listen to what the wives of the prophet are saying so this proof doesn't even work as a matter of fact it's an exact proof of the opposite that the voice of the woman is not an hour there's no hadith there's no tradition there's no verse in the quran that says that the voice of the woman is out furthermore we have the hadith and the saiyans of all of the great companion women companions and wife of the prophet was a lufty she used to give feta people would come to her to learn the religion i mean how could she do that of the voice of the woman so the voice that's number one the voice of the woman is not an honor can the woman read the quran in front of people or sing well okay can she read quran in front of people yes as long as she knows how to read the quran is it common no but that's a cultural thing but there's nothing haram about it and that's why on friday when anna was sick we had a sister read the quran and i know there were people that were upset i mean tough to be upset i mean our job is to teach islam not and practice it not to make people happy is it permissible it's permissible does she know how to recite she knows how to recite call us that's fine how about singing as long as she's not singing in a seductive way as long as what she's saying is not that which is the same thing that we would say for a man it's permissible also for a woman to sing in front of a mixed gathering is it normal would a woman come to the mosque and sing no but it's not haram why is it not normal because of the culture because most muslim cultures are patriarchal but that's not from the sun either okay so the so the voice of the woman is not an hour there's no proof for that specific proof for it and uh i've mentioned this before people like even he had hundreds of female teachers he is considered that's his title he is the commander of the faithful in hadith he's written the most famous and most uh authentic and most rigorous commentary on sahih he has an encyclopedia on all of the companions and all of the i mean he's just hundreds of female teachers so that's the tradition that we want not the tradition where it's always men doing everything so the voice of the woman is she can recite [Music] how foreign is she going to learn and teach and there are many women that are teachers of the quran that have highly jazzed us and and teach you know some of the great reciters that our men are taught by women so uh we just need to keep that in mind okay uh the quran was not revealed at a time but it is arranged in just who created this arrangement okay there were no in the quran the quran was revealed you know piecemeal of course over 23 years and the the prophet saw through the instruction of gabriel organized the verses in order and the surahs in order so the 114 surahs that was gabriel's teaching to the prophet saws and that was the quran until at hajjaja yusuf who died in the year 95 he wanted to divide the quran in seven equal parts so that he could refinish the quran once a week so that was the first introduction into demarcating the quran and then about a hundred years later there was an island named who died in the year 194 he said well maybe the hajj you know for all of his negative qualities he's using the quran once a week maybe he had time but we don't you know the normal muslim doesn't have time to do that so why don't we just divide the quran in 30 equal parts so that you can read a portion every day the idea big being that each just more or less has the same amount of letters as one another so they are roughly the same size roughly so in the in the end of the of the second century the quran was was carved up into the 30 exact that we have today and then the generations after that they said well why don't we read half of the jews during the day and half of the jews during the night so they divided each jews into two history and the reason they called it this is the time in which all of that were writing books that taught muslims things and prayers that they can say that they can say in the morning and in the evening as a way to regulate their their day and have a portion of remember and so on and so forth so they called each half of a just a hazard and then they divided it even further to facilitate that they would read in the in the different rakats of the prayer throughout the day a fourth portion so that throughout the day they can easily facilitate how they read the goods so that's how we got all of that and there are other demarcations this is more of the ones that are famous in the east i know in the west they have other demarcations they have a tone and eight and so on and so forth and this is all from the hd head of i remember you saying that it is too hard to lower your gaze as a result of the haram being everywhere it's no longer haram as long as you don't look with lust the problem is that the gym people are dressed very inappropriately so every look feels inappropriate what's your advice the idea of that statement that's a statement that is attributed to jaffa assad and imam jaffar when he was in the far east his companions complained to him that the women were not covered and they were bare chested and things like that so he said the the haramness of looking has been suspended for you because the haram is everywhere and this in the shariah is called uh it's when when a calamity is so pervasive that you cannot avoid it so that teaching there's an outer and an inner part to that teaching the outer part is that in a society like ours nobody covers even the muslim community not all the women cover so the vast vast vast majority of women are not covered so where are you going to lower your gaze that means everywhere you go you can't drive you can't work you you'll be constantly looking down like this which would create a situation that's not really not tenable so one of the principles of the sharia is when things become difficult then we automatically find a way to open them and become expensive and become easy so this doesn't mean you can go if you're a guy who can go around looking at women but it just means when you see a woman that's not covered that that glance is not going to be haram because it's just pervasive everywhere that's the outer sort of thing the inner meaning is that the lowering of the gaze is an issue of lust not looking at the woman for lust so you're going to the gym to work out not going to the gym to check out people doesn't matter what the member of the opposite sex you know is dressed like the idea is not to focus on that to focus on what you're doing if it's difficult to try to go at a different time if it's too difficult to go to a different gym you know so i mean be creative but don't say i'm having to keep going to the beach and i can't i mean don't don't teach them you're going to ask the question this is the wrong place to go to ask the question but everyone does what they can do is technical music permissible i don't even know if i should answer that question there's nothing inherently i don't know about it because it's all digital so there are no instruments for people that think that the instruments are haram which they're not but again when it comes to music and singing the good of it is good and the bad of it is bad that's what the prophet saws about poetry so there can be good poetry it can be bad poetry it can be good music and bad music uh good singing and bad singing it all depends about you know what the words are what it allows people to do so on and so forth but music in and of itself is not haram because music is sound and i think it was a he was he was the generation before muhammad he said if if you see the flowers and hear the birds and and can't understand that this is beauty and then this is music then you're a donkey right so his point is that this is natural music is something that's natural that happens outside you you go outside and you hear the sounds it's natural that's what music is just different temples and whatnot so music in and of itself is not haram it's what the music causes you to do and so on and so forth the element themselves they wrote about music we've mentioned this before okay only two more questions okay there are some in the chat a couple of until we finish these quickly when i was in high school and less practicing i would talk to and got close with someone in the opposite gender is it haram for me to text them and check up on them and say happy birthday and things of that sort and i still think about them they are muslim but it feels wrong to do so it seems like unnecessary interaction with the opposite gender and there's still a feeling of attraction and effie you answered your own question i feel wrong right so if you feel wrong don't do it right now ask yourself a question what if you're married and you do this and your wife finds out or your husband finds out would they be happy i know they answered that question they will not be happy many times i answer your questions you guys don't like my questions and you just follow what you want anyway because that's natural well he's going crazy we don't know what to say even though i'm right and you're wrong but it's okay you have established that you have the right to have your own opinion but the prophet saws you have to do what you feel comfortable with even if somebody who you believe is of proper knowledge gives you the answer still you're going to end up doing what you think is right so you know that this end is inappropriate and when it comes to the the gender interaction you have to be very careful because it's a very very slippery slope and i've said this many times any any woman can hook any man i firmly believe this doesn't matter what they look like whether any woman can book any man allah created us that way it's very very easy and any man he just says the right combination of words he can hook any woman it's just natural and as a matter of fact it's a wondrous thing it's a it's a thing that allah says is from his divine science but when we're not married we have to be careful that we don't cross that line and then we reserve that capacity and express it in its right way last question what is the first look this must be the same person what is the first look does it mean that someone can intentionally look at someone they think may be attractive once or must the first look occur by accident and before a specific person is like looking for the intent to marry can you elaborate the first look is the look that just happens you're walking about or you're at work and your eyes come into contact or see somebody a member of the opposite sex that's the first look right if we are looking at lowering the gaze as opposite of what i just said that the second look would be haram you would lower your gaze i mean that first look doesn't count but in my what i was saying earlier or the teaching of japan is that there is their first second third all of that is no longer embedded in and of itself the haram is not there because of its pervasive okay but rather it's an issue on the inside it's not to look with lust now if you're checking somebody out because you're interested in that person and your marriageable agent what now that's also that's permissible because you have to look at what you're going to to marry and this is the son of the prophet who told the sahaba to look at the members of the opposite sex in the in the case of wanting to get married to make sure that they are comfortable with that those are the written questions any questions yes you mentioned during the marriage seminar a good character and deen is most important in a man for a woman to marry how important is the family in getting married and is there a valid islamic reason for parents to deny that person if if somebody has good character and they have deen then there's no justification to reject that person that's what the hadith is saying the prophets aren't addressed to women he doesn't come from the right family or there are some oddities in the family unless it's you know something glaring like you know i don't know um it's you know parents are like mass murderers or something crazy like you're barring something extreme like that i would generally say no there is no justice there's ten i would tend to say there would be no justification to reject the person based on the person's family parents oftentimes want their children to marry in a certain they have a certain rubric that they want their children to follow and to marry and in that is mixed intention some of it is is well guided but some of it is also misguided because i said it's not just about yes the family compatibility that stuff is important but you can't reject somebody because their family are not as materially well awful but they're a good person that's that's that's a disaster uh or skin complexion or tribe or ethnicity you know i'm pakistani [Music] we all have those biases and that's why we have these texts to remind us that that's not the determination for a successful marriage all right next question i'm concerned about back paying zakat my children have investment accounts from their grandparents from their grandparents that are not retirement accounts but simply stocks to be used for education we are never paid zakat on these what we really recommend if it's the 529 is that what starts if it's a 529 there's not going to be second on it because that's for the purposes of the education if it's not in that it's not if it's not in that instrument but the grandparents as the questioner said gave it with the intention that it's used for um and last one is the big heart can you repeat that answer pink heart just like that [Laughter] um following the recent and successful heart transplant with a pink heart performed by a muslim surgeon i would like to know how muslim scholars will approach this event for a long time now pig valves are used to replace damaged vowels in the ear so as i said when it comes to issues of medicine the shadia allows generally for the use of impure substances in the case of medicine whether it be medication you're taking or whether it be transplant and things like that but shia tends to be liberal so in that case it would be okay especially if there is no alternative and i said i don't know in this case alternative if there's an alternative i think as muslim we would just prefer to have the alternative but if there's not uh and this is you know a life-saving thing there's going to be no problem [Music] but then make it your history birthday so it's as if he celebrated or acknowledged his birthday every week every monday not every month every monday now my wife heard her hand out her right hand [Music] because we will follow the opinion that says that the alcohol in that case is not the jesus not richly impure so that would be okay it's like mouthwash that has alcohol and it could be the same thing and all of the sanitizers that we've been using for the last three years that's it anything else okay you
