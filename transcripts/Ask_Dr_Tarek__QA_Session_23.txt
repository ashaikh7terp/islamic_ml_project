foreign [Music] to make this a gathering of knowledge such that the Angels Encompass us with their mercy and inshallah may this be placed in our scale of Good Deeds I mean so I have a list of 31 questions no no particular order and they're of course Anonymous so I'll begin with the list I have them the first question is must we perform ablution we'll do before showering if our previous ablution is intact or is it necessary to renew it so if you have wudu and you haven't lost your wudu it's a Sunnah to renew your wudu so in this case no you don't have to renew your wudu because you already have it if you renew it it's a Sunnah it's an act of worship I've heard that combining them water with regular drinking water diminishes its special blessing and benefits given limited access to zamzam water how should we proceed I mix it with alkaline water for daily consumption in a bottle is it okay this is the condition of the modern Muslim mind right when we think of everything and we quantify it Allah is [Music] encompasses everything in Allah Mercy encompasses everything Allah is over all things able the Baraka of drinking zamzam is not something that's quantifiable it's it's a quality that Allah has placed in the zemzem because the zamzam that we drink today is not like the zamzam in the past start out with it's it's changed its Constitution has changed its and um and things like that so don't think like that when it comes to these matters because you can't quantify the blessings of Allah if you want to pour some of the zamzam water into other water you want to pour some zems on water in your coffee in the morning do that and inshallah have the intention when you drink this like the prophet saws said that there is a accepted Dua in the drinking of zemzem and many of the many of the salahin used to subsist only on drinking zamzam so there are many people in the history of Islam that would only drink zamzam they lived in Mecca just off of that and many of the Salah Haynes they've written about their experience in drinking zamzam and their duas that was answered uh in drinking zemzem and uh there's a there's a book that's been recently published by what I believe is one of my ancestors about the blessings of zamzam and it's a it's not a long it's an Arabic it's not a long book but the Name Escapes me but it has many of these stories and many of these blessings in it so the zemzem story is something that is wide and as we said it's an accepted Dua so just take that as it is and don't be consumed with the quantity of it could we fast one day with multiple intentions including making up Mist fasts khada Rosa observing the Sunnah fast on Monday and Thursday fastings on the 13th 14th and 15th of the Islamic calendar to seek Allah's assistant with personal matters praying for the recovery of someone who's ill and addressing social issues no if you have a fast a Ramadan fast that you have to make up when you make up that fast your intention can only be for making up that fast but Imam Chef I said if you make up that fast and that makeup day happens to fall on a day that's a Sunnah to fast inshallah you will get double the reward but you can't make the intention other than to make up the khada when it comes to Sunnah fast you can have multiple intentions but when it comes up to making up a father your intention can only be to make up that fart so as I said let's say I owe five days from last Ramadan and you know I want to fast on the 13th 14th and 15th of the lunar month with the intention of making up my days inshallah I will get double the reward I will get the reward for making up the days plus I will get the reward for Sunnah but the intention for the far it has to be exclusive for the fourth as you may be aware Costco has a generous return policy along returns for dissatisfaction or product spoilage when I shop at Costco I typically purchase enough food to last two weeks however there are occasions when I don't find the time to cook or by the time I intend to prepare or consume the items they have gone bad this is particularly noticeable with organic vegetable dairy products like half and half and similar perishables I feel it's a sin to return them as it was my fault to not cook on time some friends have told me it's okay it's their policy and it's okay to return Please guide us so I actually looked at the return policy and Costco's website I didn't really find uh anything related to Foods I don't know why I mean I obviously I didn't spend that much time doing it but if it's within the return policy uh uh then from the Sharia point of view there's no problem but the better course of action would be for you to donate the food to the people that need the food because there are people that have food shortage and food insecurities and there are food banks in the area and we have a food bank type service through iccp as well um so you can do you can turn this situation into something great which is you can give the food to people that have and know that when you give a grocery store you return something and the expiration date is going to be close and they have a certain calculus for this they themselves will also give the food away So eventually it is it is donated um so you can circumvent that by donating it and get the reward or as long as you are within the policy of the return and you are not doing something to deceive them that inshallah it is permissible foreign for instance during the four rakas of the I have mistakenly think I've completed two and start reciting that the shahud only to later realize I've only done one on other occasions I may end up praying five rakas instead in such cases I restart my prayer from the beginning I make so many mistakes what should I do this matter is something that is quite simple to solve so do not make do not restart your prayer but rather if you feel if you are confused in the number of rakas that you're in you default to the lower number so I am I in automatically the answer is three automatically the answer is your raqqa 3 and build on that and if it ends up that you prayed five rakas or six rakas then that extra is just extra reward for you so do not give in to the whisperings and stop and start and stop and start but just keep going and default to the lower number if you do that consistently then that whispering insha Allah will go away if it doesn't go away then you need to see a doctor not me sometimes particularly before Maghrib I engage in supplication and then that then begins I've heard that I should interrupt my prayer and listen to the then however I've also observed some friends who continue praying despite the then please guide us what is impermissible is speaking over the then so Anna stands and gives the Aden and then you start yelling because you you want to be heard that's what's Haram but you don't do that but when the then goes and you're in the middle of then like punctures the time so sometimes it just comes upon you it Springs upon you so I'm in the middle of reading some Quran I'm in the middle of prayer or I'm making Dua it's okay you can finish that Dua and then you can repeat what you've missed from the event what is impermissible is us to start yelling you know when we were in Azad and we were in class obviously then what happened multiple times the Sheikh continued teaching if he was in the middle of a point or answering a question but he wouldn't you know start yelling over that then that's what's impermissible just like when the Quran is being recited the same question you could sort of a derivative of this question is what happens if I hear the then being recited the Quran being recited we know that we have to listen to the Quran but you can also passively listening the Quran can be playing in the background so if I'm walking in the marketplace and then is playing it doesn't mean I have to stop and sit there and listen to that then or else I'll never get through what I need to do so the point is not to speak over the would I say that then the Quran the point is not to speak over the Quran so the anus is reciting the Quran on Friday and and we're talking in the in the line and I start yelling so that my friend can hear me and I'm yelling over the Quran that's what's Haram but uh somebody asked you a question your son is with you and they're asking you a question of what time prayer starts or somebody's new to the mosque and Ernest is reading the Quran you can answer that's not Haram that's not speaking over the Quran so pay attention to that because we underestimate the power of the passive listening of the Quran so passive listening is also there's a strength in that and that's something that I encourage people to do so they get more Quran time is you should have the Quran playing all the time uh whether you are actively listening to it or not under what name should I Slaughter the sheep goat Cow drink in the future I usually use my deceased father by name by tradition is that the biha can be said under a living person and what is the benefit or hasanet for the person named in doing so okay don't phrase the question like that who do you the name that you use when you Slaughter is Allah's name you say Bismillah Allah Akbar so I hope we all understand we understand that but the idea is you want to do this act of qurban and donate the reward of this act to your deceased father uh and all of the acts that we do in this Dunya we can reward the the reward up to the deceased except for the prayer the the Namaz the prayer that's for each individual the prayer has been allotted for each person specifically at specific times everything else you can fast for the deceased you can give donations on behalf of the deceased you can do that on behalf of the deceased any type of Charity and so on and so forth and uh you could also do it for those that are living as well to donate the reward uh for that person so all of that is is permissible and the prophet saws you know he told us one of the things that all of our actions are cut off when we die except for three and one of them is a descendant that will continue to make supplication for them and we know that we can make Hajj for the deceased as long as we've done Hajj for ourselves and the Hajj constitutes of reading Quran and prayer and fasting and tawaf and Sai and do I and all of those so the Allah say if something like the entirety of the Hajj the reward can go so do its subdivisions with the notable exception of the prayer as I mentioned because it's specific to each person so if somebody has deceased and hasn't prayed or missed prayers you can't make up those prayers but if somebody deceased hasn't fasted you can make up those fast for them or you can do kafara so you want to do this for your uh deceased parent or grandparent inshallah that's fine is it permissible for the wife to lead a prayer at home I need not lead men but she can lead the prayer of their other women in the home of course women can pray in Jamal I mean we could have a women only jamaa in the mosque for example uh if we wanted to that's that's fine there's nothing wrong with that but women don't lead men the condition for the leader of the prayer in the vast majority of the opinions is that it has to be a man there is a very weak opinion that's held [Music] um by a few people actually ironically or not ironically but most notably IBN Arabi the famous but he had this position as well because he was a mushted that women can lead men in prayer basing it on the Hadith of um that said used to lead the the people of her house in prayer and amongst them was a man um but that position is to unique to be taken by us as a community because it would really have to be an extenuating circumstance so that's not something that I would feel comfortable that we or the community follow because there's no need for that to follow to follow that opinion but of course if women are you know if they're like little kids and she's teaching them how to pray and things like that that's that's different okay you mentioned on Quran night that the Quran was revealed and then was written in ten versions who was the first person who wrote the Quran and which version was used I am confused when the language of the Quran is Arabic wise it used in ten versions and by changing versions does the meaning change no the Quran was written in one script you have to be careful with the words the words that I used that there is one script of the Quran the rasm of the Quran the script of the Quran is called the authenic scriptmani and it is the definition of the Quran is that it is the entire Quran from the fatahat to the nas written in the authormanic script that is the technical definition of the Quran the quranic script the harassment of many has certain rules of how it is written and those rules of how the verses are written with that script has the capacity in the script to have the ten recitations of the Quran the recitation is different than the script there's only one script of the Quran the authmatic script but there are ten recitations how you pronounce certain words how you connect certain verses so on and so forth so there's one script the Quran is in Arabic it was written at the time of Revelation on different parchments it was gathered into one must have during the time of the Khalifa of Satan but then when it was written at that that must have didn't have any dots on the letters and then when it came to the left of Sid North men they rewrote the must-have the same most half in a clear script with the dots and they made seven to nine uh different versions of it so it's one script but there are ten ten recitations of the Quran and that has to go you know first you know how the the letters are pronounced and how they are connected and things like that and there is no change in meaning of the verses of course from the point of view of the but they have different flavors of emphasis on different components or different words but from the point of view of the meaning of the Quran of course the meanings are endless of the Quran and the tafsir is something different else that keeps going on and on and on so I hope that that is is clear inshaallah I have an Asian script Quran which does not have 15 verses on a page as you mentioned and it does not start or end with a verse that's fine the there are different printings of the of the same Quran the 15 verse per page as I mentioned is an ottoman instrument that that came about maybe several hundred years ago called Darr kanar and that just has become the standard way that the Quran is printed because it's just each just in that printing of the Quran is almost the same a number of pages each is 20 Pages if you if you have that 15 verses it starts with a verse and it ends with a verse so if you look at the most half now it'll be a little over 600 Pages because you have the fat and the first five eight of uh al-baqarah that are done nicely and in the last couple the last couple Pages uh there is the Surah heading so it takes up a little bit more page a couple extra pages and in in that printing it just becomes evenly distributed the pages and it becomes easy to memorize as I said because of the Hadith that whoever memorizes the Quran five by five will not forget so 5 times 3 is 15 so there are 15 lines and even that's one of the mechanisms of memorizing is that you try to memorize five lines at a time until you get the whole page Etc but if you don't have that that's fine that is completely okay uh this is but it is you know by the time our children and grandchildren are of age probably the 15 line must have will be the only most going to be around probably I want to ask about the hanafi fatwa regarding corrupt contracts in non-muslim countries with non-muslims does this include the buying and selling of corporate bonds here in the U.S since we do not know every single shareholder of a company should we assume that they are all non-muslims okay first of all there is nothing wrong with buying a corporate bond so it's incorrect to assume again you just you slip that in you know like as if the corporate bond is Haram there's nothing wrong with a corporate bond or a county Bond or a state Bond Etc or the or the Federal Government Bond so bonds are not I don't know who told you that the bonds are Haram even the crazies will say that the bonds are Haram or maybe they do I don't know they're crazy it doesn't matter but the bonds are not Haram so let's exclude that from the question it's not a hanafi fatwa this is the hanafi method this is the position of Imam Abu hanifa himself that contracts that have that have corruption in them are permissible are permissible for Muslims to engage in in non-muslim lands if they are legal in those lands and done with other non-muslims so dealing with river we transactions buying and selling of alcohol buying and selling of pig products if it is permissible in the country that's not a Muslim resides in and it's a non-muslim country then Imam said it's permissible for a Muslim to engage in those contracts so this is not a federal this is the position of Imam so there is a lot of confusion about that you know because you have to understand that the Sharia is a very precise instrument law usually is not law is a blunt instrument at least how it's practiced in this country but the Sharia is very fine it's like it's like think of you know like ENT surgery and you have to have fine tools to get fine you know cuts the Sharia is like that so when people ask questions that are just sloppy and this is how things can get misunderstood so the the position is not saying you all of you should go out and buy and sell alcohol that's not what it's saying it's saying that if you did that if you had a grocery store or a convenience store or a restaurant and there was that in it it would be permissible according to this position so sometimes people think that it means you have to go out and do that saw what it's saying it's saying that it is permissible because there is nothing illegal about that in this country or in European countries or other you know Muslim non-muslim countries of course you know everyone drinks alcohol except us so therefore it's something that is permissible for the reason has like eight or nine proof texts of that that are are quite strong of course the other Shafi Malik and Imam Ahmed don't say that they say it's Haram universally but he noticed in the Sera of the Prophet that there were different rules that were taking place in Mecca before the conquest of Mecca that were taking place at Medina so he deduced from that that there's a difference of how the Sharia is practiced in a Muslim majority context versus its practice in a non-muslim majority context I hope that's clear inshallah okay sorry about that my friend is starting a medical practice and just graduated from medical school he wanted to ask about interest-bearing loans taken for business and Commercial purposes are they permissible if there's a collateral asset between them like the fatwa for the mortgages yes because it does it's not a loan it is finance and the modern filth distinguishes between alone like what you find in the traditional thick which you know is Haram uh not for the ribba but for other reasons and versus Finance so if it's Finance based and it's there's the there's assets Etc then inshallah it's permissible in terms of zakah on ETFs I find this very confusing what I have done is look into the sectors that the ETF is invested in as of the zakad date and then taking a look at the percentage of commercial slash trade shares in the ETF and calculating the Care on those is this correct yes in the sense that the ETFs is it's a fund you know that is invested in in stocks so how do you pay zakah on shares stock shares first of all you have to determine is is the company that if you can is the company that you're investing in a uh manufacturing company if it's a Manufacturing Company there's no zakat on that because that is Sana that's manufacturing manufacturing you know people that manufacture medicine people that manufacture planes and things like that that's enough but if it's tijara if it's a if tijara if it's trade and or services so you invest in um you know in the cell phone company or something or in a bank with a service Etc all of those companies those shares have zakat in it and the zakaz is 2.5 percent meaning once you have the share you count 12 months a lunar year that is from the time you have the share when the Hound finishes when that period finishes you see the value of your stocks and then you pay 2.5 on that that's so that I understand the question correctly then you are doing it uh correctly of course given that the stocks the The Amalgamated mass is above the Nissan is above the minimal zacatable amount which is the dollar amount of 85 grams of 21 carat gold so you have to go I I didn't do that before I came it should be around six thousand dollars that's the minimal's accountable amount so if the shares that you owned are less than that then Austin you don't have to pay any second but if you have more than that inshallah you do then you're just going to wait till the year ends let's just say the first of Ramadan is when you pay your zakah on the 1st of Ramadan you're gonna go on to the app and see or to your account and see how much your your portfolio is worth exclude the uh manufacturing companies if you can or if it's just an altogether mixed fund then assume that you're going to pay zaka and just pay 2.5 percent on the value of the stocks so stocks they take the ruling of zakah of trade goods and that's it's it's simple like that now if you have to spend a little bit of effort you know didn't you spend effort to make the money and invest it so don't come to the Sharia and say it's too complicated like and you just you just spend five ten minutes figuring that out it's not going to be rocket science okay how can we make up for the prayers that we missed by praying the prayers that you missed so if you owe prayers no matter how many they are there is no Sunnah prayer for you you have to pray the Father prayer and when you pray the Father the prayer that you missed in the past you will be rewarded more than if you had prayed the Sunnah stand up and pray for you know another Lord that you missed in the past you praise afterwards stand and pray another us that you missed from the past and just to keep a tally and keep in mind that you are getting more reward doing that than if you were praying the Sunnah prayers can we request for Dua I have no Baraka in my house I feel that my house is not blessed what prayer recitals should I indulge in to bring Tranquility well inshallah we ask Allah subhanahu ta'ala to put Baraka in all of our homes and may the light of the Quran and the light of the Prophet is Infuse all aspects of our lives and our homes uh there are simple things that you can do for for this all of us this is so sort of for all of us number one is you have to make sure that your house is clean all not OCD clean but I mean you know clean just basically clean like take the trash out at night make sure that you know the bathroom's clean the toilet seats covered uh there's no you know trash uh around there no dishes and and you know old stuff moldy stuff growing in the in the refrigerator in the kitchen and things like that and you have to maintain a clean house the second thing is you have to um make sure that what you're eating is halal you know this is why I don't like that opinion of that you can eat any meat and chicken and things like that I've talked about that before because it can affect the Baraka because the prophet saws make sure that what you eat and drink is accept your Dua so make sure that what you bring into the house is halal and then from the point of view of the spirit and of course you have to pray it has to be a home has to be a place of prayer and when you do the prayer in the house that's when you attract the angels and you attract all of that butter that's why when you come to iccp everyone's always happy because that's all we do here's that's what we do is we pray and we fast and we read the Quran and we talk about these kind of things so this is like a concentrated place where all of those things are happening well your home needs to be the same way that when you come into the home this is a place where we pray if we can we pray as a family Etc and then other than those those are like kind of low-hanging fruits is the recitation of the Quran so you can have the Quran playing you know you can open up uh like Surat al-baqarah on YouTube and just have it playing in the background you can have it even playing when you're not in the house that's very important especially in the home and prayers on the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so I recommend that everyone um find a way to find an accessible version of which is the most famous manual for prayers on the prophet Allah there are several copies that are available in English and transliteration and you can even find audio recordings of that in addition to the prayer and the recitation of the Quran the more prayers we do on the prophet Allah the more that you will find the the Baraka in your house in no time insha Allah what forms can the Jinn take animals humans Etc and what can we do to prevent encounters with the bad Jinn so the Jinn can take the forms of people you probably met many people who you think are Jinn and they can take the form of animals and whatnot you know that exists unfortunately and even if they're not gin they act like they're Jinn um what can we do to protect ourselves from Bad Jinn make sure that you are in a state of wudu most of the time and just uh pray the five daily prayers Allah says in the Quran the machinations of the Satan is weak so even though we believe in Satan and the Jinn and his minions and so on and so forth we also equally believe that their power is very weak this idea that there's a power of evil that's equivalent to the power of good is a non-islamic belief this idea that there's some type of Duality it goes back to Zoroastrianism it's not our tradition we do not believe in the power of Satan we believe in them and oftentimes as Muslims we talk about that because we just want to hang our problems on something else and you know who our problem is when we go home and we look in the mirror that's our problem that's our problem we are our worst enemy and it was so easy to blame the the Gin the dog gin or whatever then you blame yourself so honestly the Jinn is a non-issue you should not be thinking about it one time we were in class this was an osural Phil class like at the highest level it's a very very uh philosophy and Theology and grammar and you know in my classroom the Sheikh would sit the whole first row is all of these books you know dictionaries and different books and so in case we need to look something up we're looking them up it's a very academic very Scholastic thing and we're reading the Sheikh is reading and and whatnot and then some guy walks in and then he starts asking a question about the gin so the Sheikh kind of just like he just like you know answered it similar to the way I answered it and wanted to go back to the class and the man kept insisting so the Sheikh said okay I guess there's no knowledge today and he closed the book and he put it away and he said okay tell me about you know the Jinn so it's not considered something serious it's like it's like um you know a Thousand and One Nights right kind of thing I'm not saying it doesn't exist it exists but when when when a child falls off a tree and hits their head they need to go to the doctor not to the Jinn expert because they fell on their head and as a matter of fact that's exactly what the man was telling the Sheikh he said this kid fell and hit his head and he's possessed with the gin and the Sheikh says you don't think that maybe it's because he fell on his head that that's the problem and he's like no because the Jinn told me he's like I'm telling you and you're telling me and it just it devolved into we just all started laughing because it was so ridiculous so don't give so much stock into the stories of the gin the basic thing that you do as a Muslim is enough to protect you from any type of evil and remember that you are your worst enemy and you need to work on yourself all of us I mean I need to work on myself all of us need to work on ourselves sometimes when we ask Allah for something and we Prof promise with ourselves that if Allah will accept us we will fast like for example Monday or Thursday but if we can't make it what is the compensation this is you have to expiate for an oath first of all to to to to say I'm going to do something good I'm going to pray a hundred rakas if this thing happens the Allah say that this is a sign of a stingy person that if you were not stingy with Allah you would have prayed the 100 regardless if this happens or doesn't happen so this is not a good habit to get into but if you promise if you make an oath like this and you break the oath you have to feed 10 people in the chef it's 510 grams of food per person I did the calculation before I came it's like 10 12 expiation per oath so it can it can cost you something if you keep doing it so don't get in the habit of doing that I have difficulty in making wudu in my workplace and that makes Doha prayer very difficult can I pray to her and us together later during the Oscar time yes you can pray the daughter and Asar later or you can pray them earlier depending on you know winter or summer and you can do the same with and Aisha and if you get stuck you can also if you make wudu in the morning and you put on socks you can wipe over your socks uh when you're making wudu if you have to renew your wudu that sometimes will be will be easier but to avoid the prayer and the work situation altogether because sometimes it is difficult I admit you can combine the prayers no problem how can I change my method to hanafi and sheffey is it possible is there are there procedures for it no the meth Hab is for for The Scholar not for the average Muslim the average Muslims madhub is the method of the person who teaches them so in this case either me I'm teaching you or a member of I that's what you follow but the methamp is something that's incumbent upon someone like me like when I go to study I have to study one I can't go to four colleges at the same time I have to go to one Med have one college to study that system of law as best as I can in the course of studying you learn about the others as well and you you know how you can take and pick and choose but that is required for the person who is a student of knowledge who is training to be a scholar as far as the layperson is concerned there is no matter for the layperson so don't concern yourself with those issues rather just learn how to practice your Islam in the easiest most comfortable way possible that is the best type of Islam Islam that is easy and that is what the prophet saws liked he liked religion that was easy and simple and our job is to make the religion as easy and as simple for you so don't be concerned with that as far as people that are experts and whatnot it's just following another method it's it's just like you know today I'm going to read Shakespeare and tomorrow I'm going to read William Blake it's just you just read another book and you just start doing that it's just there's nothing to it there's nothing formal it's not like a mafia where you swore like an oath and you can't get out of it it just it's about personal practice is the congregational prayer led by my son who is 13 years old acceptable at home while all others who are adults pray behind him yeah that's fine as long as he knows how to pray correctly and recites when I contribute to the disaster Fund in Morocco Libya or sadaqah yeah there are people amongst those who are affected that are eligible the poor and the need people that are in debt for sure people have gone in debt because of this tremendous uh Calamity so those people are eligible all of the rest of it would be you know to build infrastructure and stuff like that is so if you want to give zakab for that I mean I don't know how the fund is is divided but uh for sure there are going to be zakara recipients amongst those people without doubt our library has the Bible and other holy scriptures side by side with the qurans a person visiting iccp said that was inappropriate and the Quran should be kept apart well then maybe this is not the mosque for that person and then they should go somewhere else where they don't read or write but in our mosque this is a mosque based on knowledge based on the Quran and Sunnah even the sahaba themselves they used to read the Torah and they used to read the gospels and when they used to read the Quran and the prophet saws didn't object the Muslim is is we are the ummah of Iqra we are the ummah of read and recite and we have an insatiable desire to learn and to know anything so if anybody denigrates any book that we have or any form of knowledge they have very little Islam in them and this is not the mosque for them because this is a mosque that Prides itself on being open and part of being opening is learning and I can't believe a Muslim would say that that's the most ignorant most despicable disgusting thing I have ever heard honestly to to have that mentality that's a sick person that needs to be healed may Allah heal them away from us when I pray at home alone should I and that's why these questions are Anonymous so I have the right to speak like this if they were not Anonymous then I'd have to be like um and I I'd go home and have to hit the punching bag but here I can I don't know who wrote this question of course not nothing wrong with that when I pray at home alone should I recite aloud or is it okay to recite softly you can recite softly you don't have to Belt it out but but softly so you can hear it so if it's Fajr well actually any of the prayers and you're praying by yourself you need to recite so that you can hear it it has to be audible to that amount but you don't have to Belt it out in some schools of thought that Imam recites the fatah it's important that those following the mm silently recite the fatah the Imam goes on to recite the other Surah I was told that simply listening to the mm reciting was not enough and that my prayer will not be accepted if I do not recite the fat to have myself what is the correct thing to do whatever you're used to because this is a difference of opinion and the shaft we have to recite the fact even if the Imam starts reciting a second Surah that's why like when we pray with her in Ramadan all of you are in you see me still standing because Ennis is like on his last breath he's like on turbo speed now so he's like boom boom boom boom I'm still reciting my fat in our method we have to recite the fatah it's enough for the imam's recital to be for the people for you so whatever you grew up doing that stick with that this is an issue that we don't have to make an issue and just because I do something it doesn't mean that you have to do it by the way when I say that I'm just explaining to you because I was trained a certain way and that's what I do in performing we do is it obligatory to perform each Act washing three times and say salawat with each Act of voodoo no what is obligatory is your face your hand from your fingers to your elbows right and left your head and your feet from your toes to above right above your ankles one time each that's it that's the basic will do that's like we'll do for people who are in a hurry to do everything three times and to do the other acts that is a Sunnah of course you should try to do the Sunnah form as much as possible but sometimes you're stuck like the person asked about the workplace I mean don't go and work and then do like you know take off all your clothes and jump in the sink I mean that's not you don't have to do that just you can make a simple we'll do so it's it's important sometimes to learn these things so you know how to be uh how to expedite the act when you need to so no you don't have to wash them three times and all of the the Dua that is said during the wudu and after the wudu before during and after they will do are also for how long can I perform or do wearing my socks and perform successive prayers and also perform will do again as needed okay when you make wudu in the beginning of the day on your feet and then you put on a pair of socks the minute you lose your wudu while you are wearing the socks at that moment you count 24 hours so let's say I wake up in the morning at six in the morning I make wudu I pray Fajr I put on my socks and I don't lose my wadu till eight in the morning then I have until eight the next day that's the 24 hour period to wipe over my socks not 24 hours from when you put on the socks 24 hours from when you lose your wudu after her putting on the socks while you are in a state of voodoo and if you're traveling you get three days with the same rules so hopefully that yeah I don't think any of us want to wear socks for more than 24 hours anyway so that's more than enough time for you to cover wiping over your socks for future will do my friend plans to marry a non-muslim lady who was a Christian is it permissible likewise what if a young lady wishes to marry a non-muslim gentleman who is a person of the book what does the Sharia law permit allows men Muslim men to marry people of the book only the Christians uh Christians and Jews because people of the book remember is a broader a broader label any pre-islamic religion that is organized for us are people of the book so Hindus Buddhists Shinto Confucius all of those people are people of the book from the wide definition but when it comes to this issue they are not people of the book in all of the rulings allows a Muslim man to marry a Christian or a Jew in the Shafi medhab we do we no longer hold that position to be valid but you know that's we don't need to split hairs on that but there is no medhab there is no sect there's no opinion that exists in the history of Islam the Canon of Islamic law that allows a Muslim woman to marry a non-muslim man which you have to understand about this is that it is about marriage is something that is divinely legislated it's not something that's rational in all religions in all systems of course in the modern world they want to undo that and people oh he's a good person he's a good man has nothing to do he's a good man or a good person a woman a Muslim woman can marry a Muslim man and he can be the most despicable most corrupt worst human being on earth and the marriage would still be valid but when you come and ask me should she marry him I'd be like don't marry him that's bad news so it's not about just because something is halal doesn't mean that it's good and that's that's a gray area you have to learn to live with so when I say that it's not permissible he could be a saint he could be he floating and he's clean and you know he's honest and this and that but if he doesn't say that Kenny man he's not a Muslim then in the Sharia it's not valid why because marriage is something that is divinely legislated it's not something that's legislated through our rational system is it okay if I present a copy of the Quran to a non-muslim my friend has asked for a copy for his Library yeah we have many translations you can you know obviously you're not going to give him an only Arabic Quran does it make sense so give him the translation that's fine can a civil marriage be done at the County office before a formal and I would advise that you do the opposite then the cash should have happen first followed by the Civil marriage because then the Civil marriage becomes in our understanding a recording of something that has already taken place which is the nikah itself so for us marriage is a verbal contract you don't even have to write it down so if I verbally marry a woman and then we come and write it down this document is not really the contract all this document is is authenticating and confirming something that has already taken place which was the nikah so when you do the Civil marriage first and then you come to the mosque and you do the nikah we reverse that and then yeah it's not the proper way of doing things unfortunately many people do that actually they come after they come they do the Civil marriage so we always advise what we advise is you obtain the marriage license and then we do the nikah and then right after the either myself or a member if I we fill out the paperwork for the Civil marriage and then you guys take the certificate and you deposit it wherever it needs to be deposited what is the share of heirs determined by the shidia law in case of an unmarried man who has a son and a sister if the man has a son if a man has a sister and he only has a son the son takes everything is it permissible if the son and sister Yani the sister of the son saying he will take twice the share of the sister is it permissible for him to add people other than the legal heirs to the will is there a limit that cannot be exceeded a man a man dies the man has a sister and the man has a son that's it the son will take everything a man dies and he left a son and a daughter then the the son will take double the daughter is it permissible for him to add other than the the legal heirs to the will is there a limit that can be ex that cannot be exceeded this is called the bequest I will see you a man or I'm sorry anybody can leave a bequest up to one-third of their wealth to anybody and anything but you cannot exceed one-third of your wealth unless everyone that will theoretically inherit from you agree that you will leave more than one-third so let's say I want to leave everything I ever have which is very little to iccp I can't unless my wife and my children would all agree but I can write one-third to iccp without anyone's permission and this comes from the Hadith one third and one-third is a lot and this had to do with a man wanting to leave a bequest for his children and he said should I leave to the prophet saws should I leave a third and the prophet saws one third and that's that's a lot so you can exceed one-third but only if all of the people that will inherit from you will agree but up to one-third you can leave foreign [Music] these were good questions you know that's we should do that we should get as a young person to compile think there's like now almost we're nearing a thousand questions it's at least like two volumes of of yeah I've been thinking a lot about that no in that case you prayed five it's like more Baraka for you this is that's something else I don't want to complicate things because in and of itself is a Sunnah so sometimes you're so forgetful that you even forget to do that those two which is fine so I'm just giving you the Bare Bones yes if you make a mistake in the prayer then after you do this that don't start over that's the that's that's one of the pathways of shaitan start stop start stop start stop just continue make it easy and continue that's how the sahaba were one time when he was the Khalifa he was walking with some of his companions and you know the the homes there were like only like two stories so there was a lady on the top of this home and she had like a bucket of water and she threw it out you know maybe she was cleaning and she threw it out and the water splashed and then it came on them so the man you know next to said no Omar he's looking at his clothes and he and he says you know I ask you by Allah is this water Pure or nejis is this Pure or filthy water and then you'll sit now like they said by Allah do not answer this man and then he kept walking that's our Islam easy going and why would you yeah why would you think that it's something filthy you know don't you don't assume that you just make things simple inshallah again we don't want to be it's not dualistic we don't want to be either or read the Quran in Arabic when you can and struggle with that and then read the Quran in the a language you understand to understand the meanings of the Quran don't be either or but we want to do both listen to the Quran also that's the other thing I want to promote you have you have to understand we have this is a gift that we have these apps you can just have it playing you can just have it playing uh I'm not saying you have to listen three hours of the Quran a day but 10 minutes just start with 10 minutes and then add to that oh it's in Arabic then your ear gets used to it so don't be black and white either or that's like the modern trap okay [Music] thank you allowed to make money over something that that Muslims cannot participate in ourselves it seems because okay so the this is not Anonymous no the the question is based based on the the hanafi position of uh the festival in non-muslim lands could you own a casino a strip club or a gentleman's whatever establishment no I mean obviously no because this is starting a business on something that is morally uh morally Haram a corrupt contract means that there's a deficiency in the contract from the Sharia point of view like buying and selling like we can't buy and sell dogs in the Sharia because the dog is considered negis but there is a way around that because there are farmers and stuff like that it's called rafale to remove your hands on having specific ownership for a specific time which is a Sharia Lupo watch that I want to bore you with right now but sometimes these things are necessary so engaging in in ribowy transactions with non-muslims when it is legal and part of the norm of society in a non-muslim land is one thing and then me opening up a brothel or if prostitution is legal that's something else we're going to say absolutely that's Haram we don't want to be involved in something like that so there are limits next question in the morning could I put for two hours for the touching their socks yes the the 24 hours wiping starts when you break your wudu so if you put your socks on at six in the morning and for some strange reason you didn't lose your wudu till 6 PM then yes you can wait until tomorrow 6 pm by wiping which means that you have worn your socks for 24 hours plus 12. but if you think about it it's the same ruling because in those 12 hours you didn't make wudu you did because you didn't lose your wudu so I the question is trying to be clever but when we come back to it's the same 24 hours nice try are there any books texts you could recommend to people to increase their love of rasulullah foreign I think one of the the most yeah you know under underestimated things is is the importance of the Sera of the Prophet Allah and by reading the biography and the chronology of the the events of the prophet's life in as much detail as possible it really pops out you know his personality and his character his character trait one of the best siros we have is the Sera of a shibli Normani who was a Pakistani scholar and what's interesting about that Sierra is that that Syrah exists in English Urdu and Arabic I mean I have the Arabic and the English version and they're very decent uh you know trans actually some of it I think was actually written in each of those three languages if I'm not mistaken but it's I think the English is called like an encyclopedia of the Syrah or something like that because the first couple volumes he talks about the seera but the rest of the book I think it's seven or maybe nine volumes he talks about all of the other aspects of the prophet's life Isis and his family The Companions and things like that and the more the more you have a a sketch of who the prophet was and not just like some Mythic person in the past who we Revere but no like I see him in front of me I I'm living the life that he lived that is the greatest thing to motivate you to love the prophet then all of the other things after that reinforce reinforce that but if you don't have those data points sometimes the other things they slip um I know that there's the Shema literature which we taught at the mosque and there's also is the special traits of the Prophet some those are all different genres but I always Advocate people to really go deep with the seera of the prophet of course there are many Syrah books that's just one that that I always like to recommend but whatever language you feel comfortable in reading my advice is to to go there's not there's no shortage of what you can do with the Sira of the Prophet Allah they want you to repeat the name of the bag Pakistan or is it not many not many right or no amen only not many yeah many we have two more questions if we end up playing Five rakas in a player you have to do this you don't have to but it's a Sunnah too I'm gonna look it up and say any other questions I'm just trying to look up the the serum some people I'm saying they have seen the prophet in their dreams how does one know it is how do you know when you've seen the prophet Allah so there are there are several manifestations of seeing the prophet Allah one manifestation is to see him as his actual form the prophet saws said whoever sees me in their dream has actually seen the shaitan will not take the form of the Prophet is but you can also see the prophet Allah in your dream manifest as somebody else maybe somebody else that's Pious so when you wake up you're like I dreamed of the Prophet but wait a second I thought sin you know that was like my grandfather or that was some Sheikh that I studied with or something like that so sometimes a person is not ready to receive the full image of rasulullah so he can manifest in a different way but that is also a true Vision however what is not protected is what the prophet saws says in the and that's another important detail so the the Hadith says whoever sees me in the dream has actually seen me but the prophet saws never said whatever I say to you in the dream is really me because there can be something that is messed up in what is said so anything that is said in a vision in a dream whether it be the prophet assassin or some holy person doesn't matter who or another Prophet it has to be placed in the balance of the Sharia many many people have gone astray and continue to go astray because of those type of Visions so you have to remember that the speech in the dream is not preserved what is preserved is the the physical appearance of Satan Muhammad sallallahu the zamzam question was about somebody take zamzam and just pours like a couple of drops in another bottle of water and somebody told them that this dilutes like the Baraka of the zemzem and I'm my response is that this is the way the modern mind thinks which is not the way we think in other words you can't quantify Baraka it's not like there's one part per million Baraka here and then one part for 10 million Baraka it doesn't work like it's not a quantifiable thing this is something that Allah has placed in this blessed water and when we drink the water there's an accepted Dua as the prophet saws said so just take it at that don't don't it's not don't be like a chemist and Quantified it's not going to work with this so my advice was we all have zamzam a little amount and we want it to last so we dilute it and that's fine it's still zamzam inshallah why don't you think of it the other way that the zamzambaraka is so much stronger than the alkaline water at Costco that it overtakes it and it makes it all them why don't you think of it like that it's like a chemical reaction that increases the Baraka you know in time the constituents of the zamzam has been changed it is artificially or naturally how come no just over time naturally it's I mean it has changed because a lot of some of the descriptions of the past is that it was almost like milky and and and uh it's just I I don't I don't I mean I don't I'm not a geologist I don't know why but it's this is sort of just over the passage of time we pay zakat in the month of Ramadan we we assume that if is 70 or 70 something times more so we keep our zakat till Ramadan like that and pay on in the month of Ramadan what do you say about it the the thing about Zakir is the minute the money comes into your possession that's when your zakat calendar starts so you have to wait a year from that date what you can do is you can pay your zakah early up to two years early so if you want to pay it in Ramadan for the extra blessings and it's an early payment of the zakab that's fine but don't delay paying the zakah like let's say you owe it three four months before Ramadan and you're like oh I'm gonna wait till Ramadan don't do that because that money has to it's the right of the money you want to get rid of that when it's due so you can pay it early if you play around with your schedule so that the Ramadan payment is an early payment that's okay you have a fun fact no of course obligatory what Acts oh the obligatory acts of the father of the prayer uh uh is you have to say the opening Allahu Akbar uh reciting the fat and then just moving enough in each motion that there is a separation between motion and Stillness and then at the end you have to do the last and say salaam salaam alaikum on your right that would be the bare bone acceptable I mean obviously no one's going to pray like that but you could move without saying Allahu Akbar those are extra I mean obviously I'm not saying you should pray like that just like I'm not saying go opening a casino and I'm not saying go buy and sell alcohol I'm just answering the question those the skeleton of the the prayer is you say the opening Allahu Akbar you recite the fat and then you just move into rokua pause stand pause go on sujood pause sit pause go on sujood pause and then stand and then you repeat that this the first is a Sunnah and The Last Shadow you have to say the whole tahit and the prayers on the prophet's family assalamu alaikum that would be it so this is helpful when you're teaching somebody who doesn't know how to pray or somebody who just become Muslim for example and then you can build on the ax but for all those of us who grew up and are older and practicing alhamdulillah don't pray like that you know pray with all of the things really okay masha'allah is a book I mean it's after the Quran probably the most read most copied book in the history of Islam and it is written by a Moroccan scholar Imam Al jazuli Rahim who wrote this manual for prayers on the prophet it's in eight chapters and there is a chapter for each day of the week and then the last chapter the eighth chapter is read with the first chapter on Monday because the prophet saws was born on Monday so on Monday you're going to read two portions and then the rest of the days of the week there's a there's like a like a little chapter that you read for that day of the week and it's all salawat on the prophet and this is the most widespread most accepted you know most Mubarak book that we have after the Quran uh and um you know you you just dedicate a portion of reading it a day and it inculcates in you the love of the Prophet Saws and the importance of salawat because the salawat on the prophet is a form of Dua from us to Allah and there's nothing greater in the created world than saying so this is a great book there are other manuals of prayer but this is the most famous and it's something that's readily available and as I said you can get it in English and transliterated uh uh Urdu translation so on and so forth so this is you know one of the greatest things that you can do is get into the habit of reading this reading a portion a day of this it doesn't really take that long I mean it's not going to take more than 15 minutes 10 to 15 minutes all right sometime water sold in other stores is it real sold where yeah you should assume that the gems and water that's sold online or at Halal stores to be real I mean it would be very low if somebody was selling tap water and putting zanga be pretty low of them it's like the guy that said the Bible is wrong in the mosque they're like in the same camp so just assume that it's halal inshallah might that was the first question I answered no if you have your wudu you don't have to make a second we'll do okay [Music] of dollars [Music] [Music] foreign
