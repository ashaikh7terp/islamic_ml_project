welcome everyone to our open forum of question and answer i have a healthy uh stack of of questions uh some came in just literally before moments before so again i answer the questions as i receive them there's these are completely anonymous and we ask allah ta'ala to enlighten us to fill us with knowledge uh and that we inshaallah through these questions and through these answers may we arrive closer at the the letter and the spirit of both the quran and the sunnah of the prophet sallallahu alaihi um there is well i'll just and i'll just i wanted to do them thematically but maybe that'll be too complicated so anyway first question in no particular order i sometimes forget if i missed a raka in prayer what should i do so the general rule is that we want to build on the lesser amount so let us say we are praying those four raka's and then i'm standing up i'm standing and praying i'm like three the moment you have that feeling you automatically default to the lower number why the lower number is where there is more certainty and the higher number is where there is doubt and in the shariah in the sharia one of our meta principles is that certainty is not reduced or is not violated or is not removed through doubt so you we want all of our actions particularly when it comes to acts of worship to always be based on certainty so therefore we default to the lower number and then we build so in that example am i in the second raqqa i'm on the third raka i'm on the second raqqa and then i build i pray two more raka's but what if it turns out that when you finish your prayer you had actually you were on the third raka and now you have prayed five and then the shariah says and that's just extra ibeda for you extra worship for you extra reward for you and inshallah the prayer is valid so that's how we deal with that problem and this is for everyone because it happens to us from time to time what is the prayer we should recite if the imam or a congregant makes a mistake when praying or reciting during salaam we go down to sajdah so what is the dua that we say in the sajdah in sajdah which of course there are different ways of doing it according to the different medahim there is no extra dua other than what we normally say in the sajdah and i should also say that says the two forgetfulness prostrations is a sunnah in other words if the imam makes a mistake because he's absent-minded and also forgets er to make the two of the prayer insha allah is still valid because it itself is a is a sunnah at home can my son who is just 12 years old lead a prayer and adults pray behind him this is a difference of opinion amongst who said that he used to lead his people in prayer when he was six or seven years old so we can follow the shaft position because in this case there is um we want to also encourage our children to learn how to lead the prayer because they don't practice and they won't know how if the child as long as the child is what the sharia calls momayas the child is is able to to discern you know left from right right from wrong man from woman you know basic things night from day a discerning child which you know the child here is 12 i mean it could even possibly have even hit puberty if it's puberty then there's no difference of opinion all that is necessary is that the child prays the prayer properly and can at least properly recite suratul so in this case you know we should make sure that um maybe we can run his fetaha by brother annas inshallah just to make sure that he's reciting it fine and that's okay in sha allah and as always in these matters there are many differences of opinions in the sharia this is one of the the plurality of the our legal tradition is one of the greatest strengths that we have there are some matters in which there is consensus there's always ichimo so as long as we are dealing with matters in which there are differences of opinion we are allowed to follow whichever opinion is most appropriate most compatible to our condition i understand that sunnah prayer should be prayed before the federer prayer if i miss the sunnah prayer at feder and joined the jamaa lake can i pray the sunnah after there is evidence for that amongst the sahaba in that circumstances it's not the most standard position but it's permissible due to the the act that some of the sahaba engaged in it so in this case you walk into the mosque to pray fajr prayer uh and you know they're already praying you stand and pray fajr you join the jamaa and then afterwards you can do the two raka sunnah that was supposed to be before there is evidence for that and that's permissible some people recite the fatah after the imam recites but if i do so while the imam is reciting a surah i find it difficult to concentrate i'd rather listen to the imam and say ameen is my prayer valid the chef i say i must recite the fatah quietly is my prayer valid again difference of opinion in the sheikh i met her we must recite the fatah and whether you're the imam or the moon or the people that are being led in prayer for imam abu hanifa the recitation of the faith for the imam suffices for the for the listener um in the sheikh medhab the imam is supposed to pause after the recitation of the fatah to allow the congregants to recite surat al-fatiha if if the questioner the way that the question is formed i would default will say recite surat al-fatiha because it is safer and in you reciting the faith it is a fart for you to recite the fatah and the sunnah to listen to the extra recitation of the imam so to be on the safe side i would say get in the habit of reciting the fat that doesn't have to be too long and uh we can remind our imams or whoever is leading the prayer just to allow a few moments between the what about lin amin of the fatah before we start i mean doesn't have to be like forever but just a few moments you know to let the congregants begin the recitation of the fatah okay next several questions deal with divorce it is blameworthy for someone who is do is it blameworthy sorry is it blameworthy for someone who is divorced to not seek to get married again if they feel they have many responsibilities such as parenting children as a single parent such as parenting children as a single parent taking care of the elderly parents maintaining a full job etc seeking a spouse again feels overwhelming even if one does not have children but is content being single after divorce and strives to live with the bounds of islam is it blameworthy to not want to get married again no it's not blameworthy to not to want to get married again not just for those conditions but also you know the pain uh oftentimes divorce is a negative experience so the pain of the previous marriage but at the same time remember that this is all part of your risk this is all part of your sustenance your nasib and you don't know what what allah has written for you so i wouldn't approach it in this very materialistic ways i'm never getting married again and so i'm not ready to get married right now and whatever allah wants inshallah will happen and you know that way you open yourself to the possibilities because you might find somebody even though you weren't seeking that might be a suitable match there's no doubt that companionship is stronger than being lonely even though the person in the question is quote unquote struggling through these issues the elderly parents on one hand and the children on one parents you too need also care and self-care and and companionship or else you won't be able to do those other things as well but on the face of it no it's not blameworthy you don't have to get married it's just a sunnah a confirmed if one does not find a potential spouse after divorce do they need permission for marrying them from their parents or children sorry if one does find a potential spouse after divorce do they need the permission for marrying them from their parents or children you don't need your permission from your children certainly and a a divorced woman or a widowed woman for that matter can can marry herself in that case if i divorce do i have to stay in seclusion for four months and 10 days no the the for the divorce is three periods um or in the other interpretation of the verse three uh clean days after three periods uh so the differentiation will just be a matter of days but three cycles three menstrual cycles that's the idea um and uh because the next question also has to do with is a great reward for for the woman it's not a punishment it's not a curse it's not something negative but it's an act of worship it's an act of worship that carries with it immense reward that only women obviously can engage in if a wife loses her husband does she have to stay in the heda for four months without going out there are so many formalities to attend to even while grieving does the seclusion apply to older women as well the edda for the widow for the woman who's lost her husband is forma four months and ten days four months for lunar months that is by the way we should mention for lunar months and 10 days uh in the period whether the the in the period of the in the case of the widow for some reason this is one of those commonly misunderstood things the woman is meant to remain quote unquote remain in the in the house she was in when her husband passed it doesn't mean she's locked in the house it means that she needs to spend the night in that house but during the day she can go out for her needs or what if she works or what if she has to go to the marketplace or the grocery store or the pharmacy or you know visiting friends and just not being alone that's permissible as long as she spends the night excuse me as long as she spends the night in the marital house that's what that's what it means and again great reward associated with that under what circumstance can a woman seek divorce any harm any harm that she experiences from her husband whether the harm be physical whether the harm be verbal whether the harm be emotional um financial harm that the woman can seek her divorce due to any any harm but divorce is not something that is to be taken lightly i mean divorce is the prophet saw said it is the most disliked of those matters that are halal and in my experience with the divorce cases that i've dealt with they're all negative i've never dealt with the maybe once one divorce was like mutual and and civil but all all other ones are all full of nastiness and and whatnot so divorce needs to be taken not lightly and and seriously but the question under what circumstance can a woman seek divorce any harm that might befall her okay dowry questions the islamic history of dowry as you already explained in class alhamdulillah okay so we talked about dowry in the last class so we'll just answer the questions um in light of evening out the circumstances when a woman moves to her husband's house what happens to dowry and the principle it is based on if the woman has the house and the husband moves from his environment what are the diary stipulations then they don't change the dowry the mahar is a payment that the man makes to his to be bride absolutely there is no it does it's not reversed it's not up it's not a video it ha it's something that he has to pay and it remains in his limb remains associated with his person as long as he's married and he has to pay it uh even if he doesn't pay it for example when the man dies you're going to take from his estate to the to the widow the the payment that she was supposed to receive so it's something that she has to receive it doesn't matter if she's wealthy at all and more wealthy than her husband there are many examples in the in the history of islam of very wealthy women marrying men that are less financially off i.e the prophet and lady hadith and so many of the sahaba and others it's still an obligation for the man to pay the mahar to the woman is one of the one of the pillars of the marriage contract the money amount in dowry is so unbelie and so has many many o so unbelievable in different cultures these days it prevents families from coming together i mean if the amount in our culture is ten to a hundred thousand dollars what does the groom family do if they don't have the resources doesn't this prevent marriage well what they do is they go marry non-muslims because non-muslims don't have this nonsense only we seem to have this nonsense so if a woman is expecting her mahar to be a hundred thousand dollars and we're all uh you know middle class middle upper class people lower class whatever but we have a salary job and whatnot and you're expecting to receive a hundred thousand dollars in liquid cash then you're going to end up marrying non-muslims right that's what happens because these cultural norms are ridiculous and almost i mean one would go as far as to say almost unislamic the mahar is the similar mahar that women uh similar women receive her neighbors her sisters her cousins people of the same socio-economic class now there are people that that are play that game that can afford muhammad a hundred thousand and whatnot but if you don't come from that background and if you're not a princess or the you know the daughter of some extremely wealthy person etc then you can't expect that in addition we don't want to enter into the marriage with this idea of finances only because we're not creating a business you know marriage is not uh not you know joint stock company that we're forming uh so if your only lens is the financial lens oh he has to give her not just the mahar that's a hundred thousand dollars but all of you know 50 pounds of gold and and 55 outfits for the nikkei and 65 outfits outfits for the walima and a honeymoon you know around if you start looking at things material in a material sense only that's a sign that that it's going to be a disaster because allah when he describes marriage he says is that he has created from each one of you each one of us its pair and has created love and mercy between them and allow them to dwell tranquilly therein where is the money in that verse where is this idea of the material comfort when when salaam the daughter of the prophet complained to rasulullah that they had difficulty in the housework was difficult and and she wanted extra help etcetera the prophet saws i'll give you something that's better than domestic help and he taught her some altkar and some dua right this is the daughter of the greatest of creation so we need to put these things in perspective and we need to strive to be like those people and to make marriage accessible and to make marriage possible so that we can have thriving marriages as for the monetary component yes it's important that the man shows that he's serious by coming you know with a dowry and presence and all of those things but it has to be within reason uh to be able to facilitate the marriage i'm a bit confused does the man give the offer of marriage or does the sisters welly do that who goes to whose house to ask for her hand and the sister family writes the contract right well there is the the pre-nikah you know the the pre-actual legal instrument of marriage which is uh usually the man will make some kind of gesture to the woman's family uh i'd like to speak to your father or i'd like to speak to your older brother or whatever whatever sort of um welly uh guardian is is available i'd like to come over and you know i'd like to ask for a hand in marriage so i mean there's that sort of socials and those are just social norm customs but in the contract in the contract the default is that the woman's side whether it be the woman herself if there's nobody if she's older et cetera or divorce etc or the woman's welly makes the offer of marriage zel you know the man says the father says i offer you in marriage my daughter et cetera et cetera et cetera and then the man is the one that responds to that so many westerners they find that straight actually i was i dealt with the nikah in which there was a there was an issue with that and the muslim side actually of the family it was a mixed faith thing a muslim man marrying a christian woman and um they didn't understand that and i tried to explain it to them and they wanted the contract to be reversed in in in which the the man offers the marriage now it's legally from a sharia point of view that's it's valid still the contract is valid but that's not the orf that's not the custom of the muslim the custom of muslims is that the marriage contract begins from the women's side to give women the woman control of the contract because in that offering of marriage she can stipulate certain conditions she can stipulate that he doesn't take a second third fourth wife she can stipulate uh you know it's like any contract you can stipulate the things that you want to stipulate so that's how it's done and that's how we do it at the masjid you know in our in our ceremonies that's how we do it i am constantly subjected to verbal abuse by my husband yet i tolerate him and have lived with him and raised my family i cannot drag others to sort him out as it's embarrassing and disrespectful is there a dua i should recite in some cultures they have a talisman to protect one from such hazards please comment you know hasbi allah and you know make god sincerely that allah softens your husband's heart nothing is difficult for allah whilst doing your salah is it okay to recite the surah in a fast mode rather than slowly to complete the prayer it's okay as long as all of the words are pronounced in the surah so you know you could say bismillah [Music] alhamdulillah or you can say bismillahi one is faster than the other but in both you have enunciated and pronounced all of the letters so as long as you are doing that the speed is fine some say it is not proper or correct to recite the verses in a fast mode rather you should recite slowly no it's about it's not about speed it's about reciting giving every letter it's giving every letter it's right enunciation and pronunciation and that is where you need the tajweed teacher the quran teacher to teach you how to pronounce the words it doesn't have to be necessarily long i mean there are some reciters that are super slow and you know there is some danger in the slow very slow recitation that people's mind wanders and whatnot so it's not about fast or slow it's about reciting properly if one's friend is seriously sick is it beneficial to do qurbani and ask dua is there a hadith to this effect the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said treat your ill cure your ill through sadaqa through charity so when people are ill either yourself god forbid or or family or loved ones or neighbors we give charity with the intention of shift reciting you know the quran itself is a cure so of course there is benefit in that and also mentioning the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam as a matter of fact famous book the famous book ashifa which is a book that describes all aspects of our obligation towards rasulullah the reason it's called the healing is that the book is a healing and it's in some cultures and in some times in islamic history it was custom that that book would be read at the bedside of those who were sick the same thing with qasida the the famous burdha poem either the original border poem uh of kabbalah these these type of poems in which the prophet saws praised would be would be recited in the presence of those that were sick why because the mention of the prophet's name salah sallam is a shepherd so all of these things there's evidence for and there is benefit in and shife we understand that in mecca they do say between safa and by going up and down on motorized scooter is this valid practice if one can still walk without much difficulty yes the prophet sasadam performed to off on his camel when he entered mecca so whether it's a motorized thing or you know that's the conveyor belts or whatever they end up that's fine can i observe a fast on a per on behalf of a person who passed away i understand that i cannot offer prayer though yes you could fast uh for people who have passed on may allah have mercy on all of us on their behalf that is permissible in some traditions people offer salatul janessa after prayers please comment also when can a person offer janez a prayer remotely on hearing that a person passed away in a distant location i have not heard of people doing after merit the problem with that is that after the genesee prayer you have to go bury so i i don't know of anyone that wants to go bury somebody at night when the sun has set in any i mean i haven't been exposed to burials in so many muslim cultures but in egypt for example and in the united states it's the same we usually the janezah prayer usually takes place after the prayer because the body is washed like say someone dies now it's in the evening they're going to have to be washed and shrouded between now and fajr now they're not going to do the janeza necessarily at federal because fajr doesn't necessarily gather that many people and many people can't come through the jainism prayer because it's so early so the next logical prayer is and if you do the genes then you have enough time before merit to bury the body so i've not seen or heard of the that's just my ignorance i it doesn't mean that it's wrong but that strikes me as there are some issues with that or maybe they did the geneza the night before at merib because they wanna the key is to have a lot of people and many rows uh that is the the positive sign of the geneza so i hope insha allah when my time comes by the way i hope you guys come and pray for me and for my forgiveness but the burial would need to take place then the following day and that kind of gap is kind of awkward about praying the absent genes of prayer anyone can do that and there is a spiritual practice that some of the the saintly people engage in is that every day they pray the salah you know the the absent funeral prayer and they say for any muslim that has died and no one prayed over them so this is something that you can do daily uh and you can do if you specifically for a person and you're somewhere else that's fine and we have engaged in that in the mosque before in ramadan in ramadan up to what when can i have sahur the minute you hear the hamza of allah but because that's a dangerous game the fukaha advised that we have something called like imsec to hold to withhold in some of the traditions it's said that the imsec should be the time that it requires for you to recite 10 verses of the quran you know a few minutes before the actual then just to make sure that you've swallowed everything in but technically the minute the mu'ethan says that first of all has to fall has to be fall has to fall within the time of the prayer so we we we withhold a few minutes is my suggestion in the u.s there is the civic wedding by law that is needed and we have the nikah can the nakaf be done first as per islamic tradition and then followed by the civic formalities yes uh and that's typically what we do in our community is we do the nikah uh actually in our county specifically uh what i have found and then obviously imam rafael is more uh because he's actually a lawyer i i pretend to be one he's he's the actual lawyer he can comment but in in our county um what i have found is that the couple will bring the the marriage certificate and the imam that performs the nikah in the mosque signs it and then after we finish they go like the next day and they submit it in the registrar so it's almost sort of like two birds with one stone type of thing but yeah that's fine there's nothing wrong with that and i know that there are different rules in different counties and different states it just happens to be in our county in our message it's that's how it worked in most mosques women pray in separate section and i and i if they're lucky they get to pray in another section in iccp we pray in the same room which is what was done at the prophet's time salah correct i and i've mentioned this before i think the women's section is larger than the men's section which to be fair is unfair right it's unfair for us that you guys have a larger section than we have but because we love you and we want you to be comfortable and pampered because we believe that this is the spirit of the sunnah anyway i digress i of course like to pray in the same room as our brothers well that's phrased awkwardly but i think i know what you mean in some east south asian countries women are not allowed to pray in the mosques please comment well if we prevent women from coming from the mosques then we have prevented or we have caused a great a great harm the mosque is not for the brothers only not for the sisters only not for the shafi's only not for the hanafi's own no the mosque is for allah subhanahu ta'ala it's bait allah and this is where we congregate openly and freely to profess our love and worship and devotion to allah and his prophet sallallahu alaihi so preventing women in this day and age from going to the mosque is a grave grave danger absolute danger and what ends up happening is that it it sort of creates this culture in which the dean is somehow something that only belongs to men not women but this is the women that will end up having children and raising children and starting the families etc and that disconnect can be very dangerous now why is that the case because because legally speaking speaking there is no obligation for women to go to the message there's no obligation for for women to wear juma to pray to pray juma so in the pre-modern world that's how the messages were built because society was very different but now the society has changed drastically and we all need to come to the mosque because it's sort of the only place where we will get our deen and we'll be able to connect etc so also i have to understand that in muslim-majority cultures especially cultures that go back to almost the founding of islam they have been through all sorts of different epochs of time and circumstance and cultural changes so it will just take time for them to cut i mean in egypt for example here where i am right now my daughter and my wife don't come to the message to pray not because they don't have drama for example not because they don't want to because there literally is no place for them to pray except in the street or the stairwell and so you know why would my wife and daughter want to come to do that but every friday i take the boys and we go and we pray and i said there's a big that's a that's a and today that's a big discrepancy there is that's dangerous and i like to think that what we have in our mosque is not only a tremendous blessing that we should thank allah ta'ala for every prayer but also closer to the sunnah of the prophet because the mosque at the time of the prophet sallam was open in that sense the women's sahaba would come they interacted with the men sahaba they used to to uh directly address the prophet saw or directly address the khalifa there was no like banning of with that concept never really existed okay tahajjud prayer i pray two raka's and then one with as i like to go back to sleep when i feel fitter i do offer several raka's please guide i mean if you just pray two raka's uh after merb with the intention of tahejud accounts as the hedgehog prayer so a little or a lot any amount of tahedrid prayer is miraculous and heavily rewarded okay now some of the new questions that i got not that many and then i'll go to the chat is working a job as a food delivery driver for one of the apps such as uber it's permissible as it seems to inevitable it seems inevitable to have to carry haram food such as pork and things of that nature as a muslim minority community it's permissible to carry those najeset and to deliver them there's nothing wrong with that can you explain the hadith about sitting between the sun and shade as well as the hadith about tying your camel and trusting allah so the son and shayd hadid i actually did not know until i got the questions i quickly looked it up and there is a hadith narrated by ibn majja that the prophet saw saddam forbade or disliked that we sit such that like you know half of you is in the shade and half of you is in the sun the prohibition is understood to be a prohibition of of dislike not of harmony now that it is haram and it is for health purposes and allah knows knows best as for the hadith about tying your camel and trusting allah subhanahu ta'ala it means that you have to do we have to do everything within our power when we engage in an act and at the end we say yeah we ask allah subhanahu ta'ala foretold you but i'm not gonna just sit here and not do anything and then ask allah ta'ala assistance but i have to take the steps i have to take the action i have to get up i have to work hard i have to hustle i have to you know whatever if i'm a farmer i have to tend to my land and and and tend to the soil and tend to the animals but when i put that seed in the ground i say because at the end it's in allah ta'ala's hands but i've done everything that i need to do so i've tied my camel and then i trust in allah that's what it means and that's the disposition of the believer and this is as simple as it sounds this is one of the revolutionary things that the prophet sasan brought because people and even till today people of other faiths they don't understand this it's it's all or nothing it's either black or white it's either you know i'm just going to trust in the lord and you know and they and what what they mean by that is that they don't do anything they just trust in the lord or you know there is no god or god is too busy with us and we have to rely on ourselves it's so funny even until today we have these extremes whereas we have this very perfect quite rational balance and no you have to do obviously the things you have to do but you have to trust that allah is going to help you come to your assistance can you give some tips about how to overcome pride and love that remember often the destroyer of pleasures meditate on your own mortality and your own death every day spend five minutes before you sleep and really put yourself in that earth in that ground where we will all end up and nothing will sober you and nothing will humble you more than the thought of your own mortality how can one fear only allah can you give some advice how to overcome fear of other things like the jinn will the jinn have no strength not no no real strength when allah describes the jinn the khanes means that the jinn he like spits doubt and then runs away because he's so timid and so fearful you know like if you have a cat on the windowsill or or or an animal you know or a squirrel and then there's our deer in our area we have so many deer and they approach they sense your approach they run away that's like the chanes that's like the jinn so that's rational you need to understand that the jinn have no real strength or power in the shaytanic the machinations of satan and his minions is weak um uh but how do you fear allah subhanahu ta'ala or rely on allah is by remembering allah ta'ala often everything every medal has a polish and the polish of the hearts is the remembrance of allah subhana so you have to make the remembrance of allah part of your life such that the the one that you are remembering becomes part and parcel with your own being uh part and parcel with your own flesh your own dna that is it is it is impossible to un to to to to separate the two when you remember allah to that extent and when you remember rasulullah saw them to that extent then they become a part of you then you become that which you are remembering now that you become allah but that you become a constant person of witnessing of allah so you see that there's only allah you have no fear of anything else because you see that everything is in allah's hands um for example we have the story of um of talut in the quran saul the the king that was given to the hebrew prophet to the to the to the hebrews and what did he say um and when saul and his army met the goliath army the people who knew that they were going to were certain that they will meet allah what was their response how many a small group has been given victory over a large group right that's their initial instinct response because there are people that are remembering allah so how do you reduce that fear by reminding that you are in the hands of the most merciful the most capable the most gentle gentle one okay and then the last question from the questions that were sent to me a couple people in my family do not practice they are muslims and educated in their faith well if you're educated in your faith you'll practice your faith so uh we we're not it's not about a list of things that we know and we say that we're educated it's about practicing that which we know anyway they claim they will be judged through deeds and their moral compass both are philanthropic and help muslims and non-muslims allah knows best but are we to decide when he has prescribed salat and fasting i feel i should let go as they are adults thing is one is my son and i want him in a good place after he transitions words of wisdom this is a common problem in the modern world and amongst people who are western and sort of thought indeed i.e material and and sometimes they're so material that they don't see their own materialism and by material i mean that people only they are adding and and tabulating their life on like some metaphorical excel sheet as if if i have more of this that i am better if i have less of this i am bad so because i give you see even though they're giving it's still materialistic i'm giving muslims and non-muslims i have a moral compass i have i have this i have i i i anna and anna it's very material there are non-muslims and there are there are disbelievers and there are even open enemies of islam that are quote-unquote charitable with their own people and this and that it's that's not the measuring stick that we use allah has asked of us very simple things he has asked of us to pray five times a day he has asked of us that we fast the month of ramadan he has asked of us that we give 2.5 of our excess wealth to the categories uh to the eight or so categories of recipients of zakah he has asked for us once in our life if we are able to financially and able to make the hajj those are very simple allah has not asked us much but yet he has given us unbelievable resources if you come to to count here for the people that are tabulating if you come to tabulate what allah has given you you will not be able to tabulate it so how are we not able to pray it's very really that simple so this idea that islam is only in the heart and it doesn't matter no that's just all an excuse not to comply with what allah has asked of us the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam said none of you truly believe until your self is subservient and has submitted to what i have brought and that's why we are called muslims because we submit to what allah has asked of us to what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam has taught us etc so we need to remember that it's yes our hearts are important our deeds are important our moral compass is important in addition to we must do certain things that we have been asked in this case it sounds like the people in the family are older make dua for them make dua that allah turns their hearts and soften their heart there is no contradiction between leading a full secular life trying to achieve success quote unquote in the dunya and being a practicing muslim you know we are the people that showed the world that there is no contradiction we built one of the mightiest and greatest civilizations that is still benefiting humanity till today uh but these were people who prayed and fasted uh and um you know complied with the things that they need to comply with so there's no contradiction between the two the idea that the practicing muslim is the simple-minded foolish person a naive person etc etc that's just a trope it's a colonial trope really and it's i think it's time that we just you know gave that up because it's really not true we are the people that taught the world that balance between the two uh and um that they are very symbiotic so you know that's something to keep in mind as for the specific question and make dua inshallah that allah turns people's hearts but this thing about how uh are we to decide when he has prescribed salat and fasting allah has prescribed it's clear than the light of day those injunctions are established through the diffusely transmitted texts of islam the quran and sunnah they were both transmitted in the same way it is it is absolutely impossible that any of that was adulterated if you know the the way that our sources were narrated to us and transmitted to us it was transmitted by so many different people from so many different lands that is impossible that it has been made up that it has been adulterated that has been altered or anything like that the quran is established the sahih of the hadith has been established what what islam asks of its followers is clear and established it's really as simple as that we just have to follow it okay i see that there are several things in the in the chat so let me just start with the beginning okay sarah malcolm who and how does one determine emotional harm well emotional harm i mean there's some subjectivity in that of course because um you know people are different but emotional harm i would say is like sustained you know not like my husband said something to me that upset me oh emotional harm wanted divorce no but he always does that or he never apologizes or vice ver you know things like that so something that is sustained and that's why you need uh somebody to arbitrate you need you need you need the you know your local imam your local mufti the kadhi i mean that's why there is this arbitration process uh which we provide uh a member if i provides that i provide that at the masjid so sometimes you need some you know a third party that's not biased that that's trained to be able to help you decipher the exact you know or how to interpret it i go to islamic lectures and see islamic videos where ibn taimea is quoted okay that's the first mistake i'd like to read more about the scholars that are quoted for ibn tameo when i looked him up it looks like he was imprisoned by the majority of scholars at the time for his belief i'm curious to know if this is someone i can learn from or not about the sunnah yes ibn tamiya was arrested multiple times by the hola me for heretical views that he had in theology and ibn taymiyah was extremely smart clever very prolific but he was essentially a self-taught person he was sort of the prototype of like the self-taught prayer he didn't really have a sheikh or mashayikh plural whom he studied with extensively and most likely that was part of the reason why he made grave grave mistakes in those matters of theology now the problem with mistakes in theology is that mistakes in theology lead to heresy even to disbelief whereas mistakes in fick or interpreting the hadith or this for legislative purposes you know you can sort of i'm sorry i made a mistake and it gets corrected and it's less serious and that's why the aleman arrested him or because you know he was creating fitness at his time now ivan tamiya did recant um [Music] but he sort of recanted his renegade his recantation et cetera anymore to make a long story short he was arrested eventually he actually died in prison uh can you learn from ibn tamiya ibn tamiya has a lot to teach on various subjects in the legal field bentaymaya has offered many unique positions many of which have become established in civil codes legal codes in muslim majority countries such as a triple pronouncement divorce counting as one pronouncement and for those of you who are so interested in that you can read my book on codification of personal status law in egypt in which i discuss ibn taymeh's legal position however ibn tamiya is not to be taken in matters of theology because his theology is not sunni theology it's heretical and it's anthropomorphic and it allows for the ability for muslims to excommunicate one another to take fear of one another uh and and as you can you know it goes without saying that's sort of the fuel that has caused this rise of extremism within the family of islam over the last 100 years or so unfortunately all of those groups use as their justification the theological positions of ibentemi so we have to be fair when we talk about these people but ibn taymayyah is not one to because it requires you to know these differences and most average muslims can't no evan teimei should not be used as a source um as a source um or or i won't say that i would say it in another way you need to be careful what you take you know if there's like a quote by ibn tamiya like be be good don't be bad be happy don't be sad okay you know that's fine you know and or if you know that there's a legal position uh wiping over the socks for example that people ask about wiping over the socks and i say yeah in the hambali there's a position in the hambury method that allows that's the position of it by the way it's a weak position but you know the other have allowed it and its use so there you go that's something that we benefit from but in the theological stuff until hate and whatnot no it's it's very very problem it's not sunni i mean essentially um so one one must be careful now if you find somebody quoting from ibm tame all the time that's even more problematic because that's not the way of the i mean there are other alame there are that are more steeped in different subject matters than ibn taymiyah so if ibn tame becomes a person's you know non-stop quoting source that's problematic if somebody refers to ibn tame islam that's also problem it's not sheikh islam that's something that that his followers a title given to them him by their his followers uh to sort of promote his aberrant thinking but islam you know like in the shaft islam is you know the people that were universally understood islam uh in the umma so that's a little bit about ibn taymi can we pray mahrib just at sunset or just at noon they say that may amount to worshipping the sun so i mean my screen for some reason is dark there are two times in which the prayer without a reason is prohibited and it is when the sun is actually descending in the horizon the disk of the sun is descending and the opposite when the disk of the sun is rising yes to avoid any sort of um uh confusion that we might be worshiping the sun or something that is a hadith of the prophet sasan but without a previous so let's say you woke up late for fajr praying feder is an obligation you have to pray it so it doesn't matter even if the disc is up or down you have to make that prayer up you have to pray it so if there's no the prohibition or let me say it another way the prohibition is i'm just going to stand and pray two raka's no just wait for the sun to set or wait for the sun to rise but if there's a reason why you're doing that prayer and that reason precedes the act of the sun rising or setting it's fine can you please comment on the concept about sufism or the practice of predating rasulullah well there was no well there there was i mean you mean in the time before islam um you know the remembrance of allah subhanahu ta'ala or the remembrance of the almighty has been the message of all all prophets before the prophet i mean prayer the prophet saw him said there is no good in a faith tradition that has no prayer salah in prayer so prayer is a form establish the prayer for my remembrance so the the prayer that we do or any religion does the heart of that prayer is the point of remembrance as for tasaw from the point of view of tesco of self-purity i mean that's what why allah sent all of those messengers to help purify those people's conducts and to put them on the right path so that's part of faith tradition can you repeat your response to the question about the husband abusing the wife and what can the wife do to bring about mental solace and harmony can you remind us about leila and majnu we have some at iccp who are struggling yani what i said the woman is dealing with a difficult husband who's abusing her verbally etc but doesn't want to seek me you know counseling or someone to mitigate the problem because it's embarrassment et cetera so she's sort of taken her decision so what what can she do her thicker can be has to be allah for me allah is enough and he is my protector or and or there's no power or ability except allah subhanahu ta'ala those can be hard and to to constantly turn to allah to ask allah to soften the heart of the husband and if the husband is there or listening or something like that you know remember allah subhanahu wa ta'ala you don't want allah to deal with you the way you are dealing with your wife allah the prophet saws be gentle with those amongst you who are curved the the fragile ones because the curve because the eve came from the rib of adam the rib is curved it doesn't mean some people translate as crooked that's that's a horrible translation doesn't mean that it means that the woman has her own way her own style and we as the man we have to be gentle with that style we have to respect that style that's the way she is and she's perfect that way allah made her that way and i have to so i have to change to be um to attend to her that's what the verse means and men have a degree over women a degree of responsibility so uh that that's uh those are the things that we have to remember leila and majnun that's about crazy love you know majnun is crazy that's what majnu means in arabic it's crazy he was crazy about leila uh and he would kiss the walls and they say why are you kissing the walls i'm not kissing the walls i'm kissing the walls because these are the walls where layla lives you know everything reminds him of layla and uh that's the that's the example of of love between you know men and women that we have in in islam i mean one of the examples that we have uh a man and a woman when they have that kind of you know passion between them it's a beautiful thing and this is the passion that the prophet sasam had for his wives and they had for him of course and that's our example how late can you pray before the allah don't wait that long dealing with acute illness during ramadan including coveted symptoms how to do fasting well if you're ill you have the dispensation to break your fast allah says if you are ill or traveling you can make up the days later so sickness is in the sharia is two kinds sickness that we inshallah pray is temporary and sickness that we unfortunately is ongoing so these type of sicknesses with these symptoms inshallah they're temporary temporary it might be like a year or two but it's inshallah we know that we're going to get better and it will go away so we can make up the fast later inshallah so i have to say i'm a little concerned about all of the divorce questions and i hope that you know aside from answering the questions i really hope that we can find the time to address this as a community because what's the point of having this community and doing all these functions if all of our marriages are troubled and failing and whatnot and we want to have thriving happy loving you know passionate marriages and households and happy children and you know we want our like a little utopia in in the in the uh craziness of the world around us so i really think i'm going to talk to imam referee uh but i think we should do something more uh concentrated on families and couples and and marriage and hopefully we can try to to offer some advice and and some tools and skills that will help us improve the quality of our relationships uh all we are really is an amalgamation of all of our different types of relationships so you know that's very very important and we've we inherit things from our parents and from cultures and the dominant culture and you know sometimes these are good but sometimes they're not so good so inshaallah i want us to i want to do something you know in that regard because i don't want people to be i don't want there to be people struggling or in pain and that we're not addressing it so inshallah maybe after ramadan um so subhanallah we're in rajab already subhanallah so maybe after ramadan we can do something about that i hope people agree or want to do something like that any more questions before we wrap up okay thank you very much take care you
