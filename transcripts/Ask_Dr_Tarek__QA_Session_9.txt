so there are quite quite a few questions i have almost 30 questions and many of them are multi-part so we'll just jump right in inshaallah and this is again these questions are anonymous and they're in no order i just i printed them out and we'll take them as they come one by one please explain what the quran says about temporary marriage mutha it is known as sige and iran can a woman go for this marriage and leave the husband without consequences what if there will be a child and what about the mod et cetera temporary marriage is one of the fifth issues that divides the sunnis and the shias it's something that none of the sunni schools acknowledge and it's something that is considered abrogated man it existed in the early part of the the time of the companions and it was later made forbidden so for us the temporary marriage is is not permissible some of the shia allow it but it's considered highly disliked by them so a common sunni misconception is that the shia is like you know all the shias are engaging in this and that's that's not the case uh in the in the shia the jaffa it's a marriage it's a it's a normal marriage but it's given a certain time period so in the contract you know i'm going to marry you for a week i'm going to marry you for a month i'm going to marry you for a year and then that makes in their fifth the marriage halal necessary the any progeny that happened that would come would be attributed to the parents so on and so forth but it's something that is not permissible for us and as i said it's something that is from my understanding something that is highly disliked and frowned upon by the shia i was in dammam saudi arabia there was a cemetery in front of our house i saw one day people with bulldozers on it is it allowed to plow through a cemetery in islam what about the bodies i mean not knowing the details of what was happening but the general uh question is can you plow over a cemetery no of course not that's that would be haram because the cemetery is the resting place of our brothers and sisters and it has a certain sanctity to it um and in normal circumstances that wouldn't be permissible now there are some extenuating circumstances where from one point of view all of earth at some point somebody was buried somewhere so from that point of view uh another one can extrapolate from this what happens if we're building something or building a housing unit or an office building or commercial center or something like that and then we found that there were graves unbeknownst so there are different ways so the different ways of dealing with with those circumstances unbeknownst there's you know some kind of dispensation knowingly no that's not permissible in some parts of the muslim world some marriages are legally done for convenience and ulterior motives and sexual exploit and then immediately there is talaq as this this has to do with people's intentions if the conditions exist in the marriage that there is a correct marriage contract that there is you know somebody's not marrying a haram relative uh that there's the mahari no you know the legal conditions then the marriage is valid just like any type of contract would be valid but this the question has to do with the niyyah with the intention as the prophet saws taught us all actions are based on intentions so if somebody's intending by the marriage or the marriage contract something haram then they're going to receive some kind of of sin and that's why consent is very important when it comes to marriage that there has to be consent on both sides and as a matter of fact that's why in islam the marriage contract begins with the woman the woman is the one that makes the proposal not the man to ensure that her rights are are guarded and that the man is the one that has to accept those conditions so a woman can add conditions to the marriage contract and as long as the man accepts them then the marriage is valid is there an authentic hadith that states that if you do not speak to someone for the three days your dua is not accepted can you please elaborate on this and are there exceptions to this such as avoiding escalation there are many hadith that talk about the impermissibility of a muslim avoiding or a muslim not speaking to their muslim brother and sister for more than three days and the hadith that the questioner is referring to most likely is the hadith of the fifteenth of shaben forgives all of the people that are making dua on that day except the person who is avoiding their muslim brother and sister the other hadith that are specific about not speaking to your muslim brother and sister for more than three days is actually even worse than even more intense than this which is that the person uh you know god forbid may allah protect us can that can cast somebody into the hell fire without allah protect us so what does that mean there are many hadith with that phraseology what does that mean so there are different types of of avoiding your brother and sister there is dispensation in the sharia for avoiding your brother and sister or avoiding another muslim if it is a way of disciplining them so for example my one of my children would do something wrong and i would ignore them for a day or two to emphasize for them how serious that was you know a parent to a child a teacher to a student so on and so forth so that exists so that's a disciplinary so that's not part of what we're talking about there's also a concept in the sharia of avoiding dealing with people of open buddha so people that are um just they have the wrong islam or or they're you know crazy to the crazies you know in the community and they're just openly that they do weird things they say weird things and you say no i don't wanna i'm not gonna be with those people because they're just off you know off what is normal uh as a way of avoiding contact with that bid out that so that's not part of what we're talking about what we're talking about or what the question is talking about is that me and a friend or me and a relative we have a falling out and i'm never going to talk to you again that's what's haram meaning that when they when i see them i don't say salaam and they don't say salaam i go out of my way not to be with them i go out of my way not to talk to them that's that's a big a big problem a big big sin as a matter of fact and many dozens and dozens of hadith to talk about that so this is not a good a good habit and you find this unfortunately a lot in families you'll find that there are family feuds and uh when you analyze them they're all back to some kind of dunya nefc aspect somebody feels wrong somebody feels slighted oh they did this at my wedding or they did this and in this incident and we're never going to speak to them again that's not our way how do you break that by saying assalaamu alaikum to them you know maybe it's aid you send them a message uh maybe it's somebody's birthday you send him a message you know it doesn't mean that you gotta speak do you have to be their best friend sometimes they're just you know the relationship is damaged but you don't want to be in a position where you are avoiding and not speaking to them at all is it true that you cannot make dua for a non-muslim except to ask allah to guide them allah says my mercy encompasses everything everything muslim non-muslim inanimate objects the universe everything in the created world mercy extends to everything so how can we not ask for allah's mercy for something that allah himself has already asked has already indicated that his mercy extends to so there's nothing haram with that inshallah on fridays one iranian lady visitor wanted amohar i believe that's how it's pronounced i gave her a piece of folded cloth is it allowed if we buy some muharras for iccp and use when needed in in the jaw funny method one of the conditions for their prayer is that the sujud has to be on a natural non-fabricated uh substance so many so many of the uh shia mosques they have these clay you know like tablets or circular tablets that they use for their sujud in the sunni schools it is sunnah to prey on natural unfabricated products it's not it's not it's not a necessity of the prayer but it's a sunnah so the way that we can deal with this or we can address this out of respect for our shia brothers and sisters that might want to come to our mosque is we can have straw mats straw mats in the mustard uh or straw mats that are like sort of the size of a prayer rug that can easily be rolled up you know bamboo or some kind of straw or something like that and they can prey on them why wouldn't we go by the the muharram because this item is now a symbol of teshaiyo it's a symbol of shia islam and we're not a shia mosque we're a sunni mosque but we respect our brothers and sisters so we wouldn't go out and buy that specific thing because somebody's going to come to the mosque and see it and think oh this is a shia mas because now it's a symbol but to acknowledge that this is how they pray and to acknowledge that this is what they do we can provide stromats and we can fold them up and as a matter of fact if many north african mosques sort of in libya west to morocco and mauritania tunisia many uh because it's a it's a sunnah uh especially pronounced in the melaki metham and all of these countries are maniki you find strawmats in the massages all the time so there are ways that we can be respectful but at the same time maintaining our identity which is important is financing a car or house through conventional financing as opposed to islamic financing like guidance or uif considered usury and therefore forbidden in most methods no the position that we follow uh is that as long as when you are financing something there's a thing there's an object a house a car furniture whatever then the finance transaction is halal so that's a principle of of modern of of our modern fatwa system i would like to develop more intimate relationship with the quran but do not know where to start my daily readings seem routine not heartfelt do i begin learning arabic delve into tafsir are there any online programs you recommend for guidance and following so the quran is is one of these things that you can approach it from multiple angles at the same time one thing that i like to recommend is for people to listen to the quran it's so easy that you know you have your your phone and you have an apple an app and you can find a reciter who you have an affinity towards and to get used to listening to the quran having the quran playing all the time is something that is very powerful and it will have an impact on you it's not going to have as much of an impact of course as understanding the verses so finding a resource that you can understand like say uh you're you really like the story of yusuf alaihissalam and you like you want to learn about that so take that opportunity to learn what those verses are saying al-tafsir.com a-l-t-a-f-s-i-r-l-tafsir.com is is an online resource that i recommend to people where there are dozens of languages the quran is you can access the quran in dozens of languages and in english i don't know how many tafsirs are available but there are multiple tafseers available in english in addition to all of the known english translations of the quran if you select the surah select a verse you can simply cycle through the different translations of the verse it's a very easy to use website it's trusted i know the people who have run it i work with them on another project so that's something that i would recommend so learning the verses of the quran of course learning arabic would help the arabic of the quran so there are courses that you can find online that teach arabic quranic arabic because there are a limited amount of words in the quran and roots arabic roots that are used in the verses of the quran's obviously if you learn them you're going to have an exponentially higher of that you read so without doubt all of these approaches one of the things that one of the themes for tonight and and i found in the questions is many of the questions come from this binary mentality it's either this or this and unfortunately as people that uh as westerners this is one of our handicaps one of our handicaps one of the the ways that the western mind thinks is everything is a binary it's black or it's white it's yes or it's no it's this or it's that you're with me or you're against me you support this or you don't support this this idea that there's no it's not binary or even tertiary but they're all of these shades that's something that is found more in the east and one of the frustrations that westerners have when they you know journey to the east might be that they you'll hear comments like it's not organized it's random uh they drive all over the place they don't follow the rules this is an extension of this well it's not it's not binary the rules are not binary so in some aspects of life it's a problem like in traffic laws uh of course you have to follow the rules but in most other aspects like this it's not binary so there's not one answer listen to the quran look at the quran even just even just holding the muslim looking at it you get reward for looking at those verses there are many beautiful calligraphic verses that you can adorn your house with or your office with or your prayer room with listening to it looking at it uh reading the translation reading a tafsir in english in english you know the tafsir of jalalene is translated the of imam razi there's a huge project to translate the whole thing i think the first two volumes is are translated uh i think there's a um the tafsir of ibn ajiba which is a later sufi tafsir the tafseer of ibn kethir all of these are tafasir that you can find in english so listening to the quran is going to have one impact reading the tafseer will have another impact learning the arabic or some of the arabic will have yet another impact so on and so forth the important thing is that we want to continue to have a relationship with the quran and don't let the binary mentality stop you or thwart you from those efforts if the man of the house is exhibiting mental illness and does not have sound judgment or is extreme in behavior do the wife and children have the right not to listen to him this has an impact on the family and the health of the mental state of family members is there general advice you have for the situation and the problem with this question is if i say yes but every woman who thinks her husband is crazy and every woman every muslim woman i know at some point thinks her husband is crazy it'll be like oh dr tarek said that i don't have to listen to you so this is very subjective what you know exhibiting mental illness and whatnot theoretically of course if a man loses it and starts doing crazy things in the house and things like that of course there's going to be a point where okay the man has lost his his sanity and you're not going to have to necessarily follow that but i don't want people to take this as an excuse you know to create problems at home the home is supposed to be built on mowed as allah says love mutual respect mercy and these are the themes that we need to search for in our homes this idea of who's obeying who in the home if we start to think like that then we've kind of reduced family life to to rules and and who's obeying who and that's not really how allah has described it for us allah has described it to us that a home is a plea you know the home in arabic the word for home in arabic is it's a place of the words that begin with the letter meem mesken mesjid the place of sujud mataam the place of restaurant the place where you eat mexican so the home in the arabic language is called the place of sekina the place of peace and tranquility that's those are the themes that we need if we start auditing one another and see who's obeying who then we've kind of lost the the spirit of of home life and married life and things like that so obviously for the question if there is some serious mental illness or extreme behavior then yes of course you know you can't you shouldn't follow follow that because the uh there's no dictatorship in the household but i don't want this to be an excuse for there to be further problems okay there's a lengthy question here about free will and as a matter of fact one of the later questions i got before i signed on was also about free will so i don't think i'm going to read all of it but let me read some of it currently in research universities the faith of muslim students are challenged with human free will in a predetermined universe as the subject of complex academic debate under the heading of determinism in scientific disciplines such as mathematics physics etc etc how do we rationally explain the existence of free will in a divinely preordained universe with pre-recorded history and then the person mentions all of these verses allah creator of all things allah has created you and what you make nothing happens except that allah has decreed it for us so on and so forth to understand free will and this issue of free will and predetermination it's important to understand what the knowledge of allah means when we talk about so rather than focusing on free will and predetermination and it has it has to do with me think about what is allah's knowledge is allah's knowledge all-encompassing yes of course that's something that we believe and that's a fundamental aspect of allah so if allah's knowledge is all-encompassing then that means that must mean that allah knows everything that was is and will be so in allah's knowledge keep in mind that there's no time with allah is not a being in time we are a being in time but the dimensions that creation is created in space time mass color location possession all of these things which in the study of logic are are we call them in islamic logic the ten dimensions none of these apply to allah subhanahu wa time nothing is like allah allah is not like anything so one of those things is time there is no time with allah so from allah's perspective if we can say that um i don't i don't i usually have a stick next to me i don't have a stick but uh you know if i use this piece of paper you know if this is the if this just the edge of the page if this is time you know we are like on the line of time so from our perspective we can we can remember what happened before we know what's happening now we don't know what's happening in the future but from allah's perspective it's all one thing there's no past present and future with allah and that's how we start to understand how we reconcile the two from our point of view we are free because we are we we do things and we will be rewarded or punished god forbid for the things that we do why why would we be morally responsible if everything is just predetermined so when we the word predetermined in english has a loaded western meaning to it this idea of deter even in the questioner said determinism we're not saying that in islam we're saying that allah knows what will happen allah allows what has happened but you as the person as the act of the person conducting that action you are responsible for what happens you don't know what's going to happen so you have to try and you have to plan and you have to do good and so on and so forth it's actually quite a simple thing from islam this problem of free will and predetermination really is a western problem and of course you know all of these research universities these are all bastions of secular in the west now secular atheistic thinking you know so uh when you go to the university this is not where you go to get close to allah they don't talk about that kind of stuff in the university it's almost you know laughable if you're a believer and you go to these classes and i've been in classes where the professor will laugh at people who profess uh belief in god and things like that so this is the the role of of people like me and the masjid and our community is to reinforce our belief and to help our children understand the background of why the university is like that now because if you understand the genesis of that or where that comes from it will be easier for you to deal with it you know we we live in a society that for the last couple hundred years has on purpose put metaphysics and religion and cast it to the side completely in its way of thinking so that's in a 200 years later this is what you're gonna get you're gonna get these type of of of uh situations where um they will profess that there is a problem between revelation and science or reason and revelation but we don't have we've never had this problem this is a uniquely european problem islam has never had our leading scientists were the lame we have no problem whatsoever with scientific discovery we invented the scientific method remember talked about the empirical the empirical method long before bacon talked about it as a matter of fact many many online are of the understanding that western thinkers like roger bacon and others took the scientific method and the pickle method from the science of as articulated by people like al ghazali so on and so forth so we have our our religious belief is completely different we have had no such experience in islam ever that there is some kind of conflict between science and religion between because we understand what i just said is that this is about the knowledge of allah but of course i am responsible for my actions and it's a it's a balanced and a balanced approach a clarifying question per my understanding the quran refers to ibrahim alaihissalam as the first muslim therefore how do we categorize previous mba again this is the our western binary thinking allah calls ibrahim alaihi salam the first muslim meaning the first muslim of his time or the first muslim of his area or the first muslim of his region so on and so forth not absolutely the first muslim because all of the ambient were muahidoon they were all monotheists etc if i sleep whilst reciting the quran for an hour sorry for half an hour or so is it permissible for me to continue to read when i wake up from my sleep what do i have to make with you again i read just by just the quran at the whole quran with the 30 jews all together oh okay i see i re you read the like the the booklet is one just at a time one juice a booklet of one juice that's not the quran in the fifth definition as i said before the fifth definition of the quran is the entire mushaf from the surat al-fatiha to that book that must-have that's where most of the men say you have to have to read from it with the exception of ibn hazem who said you don't have to have wudu and that's the position that i follow on the position that i teach in order that we do not prevent ourselves from having a relationship with the quran however in this case if the person is just reading a juice at a time there is no precondition to have when you touch that so in this case it's fine whilst reading the quran is a permissible to cross your legs for comfort to sit awkwardly or should one sit as if in prayer whilst reciting the quran to respect the quran can one recite while lying down on bed because this is a restful and easy on my body and sometimes i fall asleep reciting that's fine because all of this is cultural and subjective if you go to mauritania they're they lie down you know on the floor all the time reading for and studying the teacher the student so this is all all cultural as long as you're not doing it with the intention of disrespect it's fine i lost my daughter a few years ago allah have mercy on her and make it easy for your family she was a good person and did a lot of good to people but she did not pray her daily prayers i prayed to rakat for her every day since she passed but would like to know what else can i do for her so one of the things that we can't do for the deceased is pray for the uh that's that's gonna sound wrong the way i said it forget what i just said let me start over if somebody has passed away and missed fasting days the descendants can fast on their behalf if somebody has passed away and not performed hajj the descendants can perform hajj on their behalf all of those things except the prayer because allah says that prayer has been prescribed to each person in its a lot of times so if somebody has passed away and missed their prayers you as the living descendant can't make up those prayers for them so but you can do sadaqah you can give charity you can make dua you can recite the quran and donate the reward to them you can create some sort of sadaqa and you know you can donate to the mosque in their name and that's an ongoing charity so on and so forth i stopped myself in the beginning because i used the word prayer because obviously in english we the word prayer includes our salah our namaz and our god so i didn't want it to make it sound like you can't make dua no you can make dua of course and insha allah allah merciful allah as the mother as the parent or father or mother allah will accept your dua but you can't make up the prayers that they miss that's something that's between them and allah subhanahu wa i pray my five daily prayers and i do sick and also midnight prayers but i don't know how to read the quran is there any other things i can do can i just listen to the quran and say ameen since i can't read the quran yes i encourage everyone to listen to the quran i can't encourage that enough i have missed father the prayers from when i was young that i am currently making up okay good for you may i do these makeup prayers during times that prayers are discouraged yes because if you have a pre uh reason pre-existing reason you know in the medicine they say pre-existing condition you have a pre-existing reason for saying a prayer than the times when prayers are discouraged and forbidden don't apply for you when the shariah says or we find a hadith that says at this time when the sun is rising or at this time after us a prayer is discouraged etc that means just regular prayer i'm just going to stand and pray 2 raka's that's what it's referring to not that i've missed something that i have to pray because that's a fard on me and the father supersedes those times i lost my place okay can you please provide some guiding principles to identify questions that we should avoid asking akin to beni is asked about when i tell you don't ask the question don't ask the question just leave it at that again the this i i this uh don't nitpick so when you ask and i answer and then you follow up and i say that's enough then that means don't ask more is it permissible to have one's teeth filled if not medically necessary yes why are guys clothing rules less strict than girls this is a cultural question this is a question spoken from bias you think because of your cultural bias that the man's dress is is less strict than a woman i.e you see a woman's dress in islam as restrictive or limiting so on and so forth that's our that's our cult that's our cultural bias that that's as something spoken from by in another culture one would say that uh the woman is protected that the woman is honored uh that the woman is valuable uh and precious and protected and our whole system of sharia and society manifests that and the man is you know the man is less so for example i'm just saying this because i want us to be aware of our bias sometimes when we ask questions i understand the question i'm just saying sometimes we're biased when we ask these questions that's a total western you know islam is repressive baggage in that question i'm not saying that the person asking that question actually meant that but that's a bias it's very clear the dress the way allah has told us to dress this is something from allah subhanahu ta'ala there's no necessarily rash i can you know try to oh the man works the woman doesn't work but then what happens if a woman works so i mean that kind of answer doesn't really i don't like those kind of answers because they're limiting they were sahabi yet women sahaba that fought in the battles so i can't say that oh the woman is dressed nicely because she's always at home and the man is dressed you know goes out in shorts because he's working i mean most of the guys i know don't do manual labor they're sitting at a desk or at home so that that type of answer doesn't work the more real answer is allah says so and we comply with that to the best of our ability why did allah prescribe a double share for men in the family versus the woman's sibling will a wilk override this and is it islamic to do so well there's only that one instance there's only that one instance there are instances inheritance law where women inherit the same as men there are instances in inheritance law when women inherit more than men there are instances in inheritance law when women inherit and men don't inherit at all the portions of the inheritance are the size of the portions of the inheritance are all based on the closeness to the deceased that's the that's the measuring stick not the not the gender in the case where there's a man and passes away and he leaves a son and a daughter the son takes the double share and the daughter takes one share because the son's extra share is that he now needs to provide for his sister that's the key and that's what that that's the aspect that just sort of falls you know people forget about that if i inherit a double share and i have a sister that double share means i'm supposed to take care of her and that share that goes to my sister is completely her she has no obligation to use it to spend it to support her family so on and so forth but i as her brother you know even if i'm younger i still have to support her so don't forget there's those two things one is the closeness to the deceased is what will determine the closer you are the larger the share and if there is in this case the double share etc it indicates the responsibility the financial responsibility of one towards the other oh the will in the in in the in the shadia we have we have something called the bequest we'll see in the sunni schools you can give or we'll see you up to one third of your wealth but no more than that without the permission of all of those that would inherit so let's say i have uh a hundred thousand dollars to my name i can give one third of that to one person and write that and then that that happens but the rest the other two thirds that will have to be distributed through the uh sharia portions um i have two time sheets for my town with the start and ending times for the fast the problem i have is that there is a minute or two discrepancy which one do i follow this is a problem i have avoided talking about because it can become a big fitness in the community if it comes to fasting follow the earlier time to be more cautious when it comes to praying fajr follow the later time to be more cautious uh that's just as a general guideline there is a more correct answer i don't want to get into now because it will i don't want to create fitna i love the timetables but just so you know there are different ways of calculating the angle of the sun and whatnot and there are different fick bodies that use different angles to determine that now i've evolved a little bit in my my uh i used to be super strict on this but then i realized after talking to some of my teachers that all of these attempts are really heady attempts so i'm not i don't want to criticize one system i follow a very specific angle uh observation of federer and nysha because i believe it to be the most accurate one but i do also acknowledge that there are other attempts and and you know and whatnot so again to repeat for the person that has this problem and it's really only a problem with fajr is that if you're fasting and you have these two timetables follow the earlier fetcher to ensure that you have started your fast when it comes to the fragile prayer itself then you can follow the later time also to ensure that feature has come in that you haven't played early i own several housing properties townhouses and i rent them out throughout the year do i pay the care on the value of the townhouses and if so what about the mortgage i am carrying no you don't pay zakah on the property you pay the cap on your the cash that you have in your possession that that's over the nisab amount that one year has passed so you don't you don't pay the account on the value of it's not a tax uh please elaborate on how to overcome what sunnis here in their head and hearts about the shia school of thought in a nutshell they are not right totally on the wrong path etc we are almost americans living in the climate of revising our history and social norms for example blm times up domestic violence sexual orientation it's that muslims also have to revise and reorient our perspectives and align with the true practice of islam and the prophetic style of tolerance and true love for others how do we negotiate be okay with the idea of twelve imams shrines or do we in daily life how do we impart respect to those who believe maybe not right on a different spectrum belief system etc okay well when it comes to the shia thing was there more to that question yes there was more tonight please speak about the recordings in our heads about shia ahmadiyya other groups that we have learned passively to not be on the path and what they should be replaced with as a basic muslim platform that we can and shouldn't calculate within ourselves okay so with the shia thing your education we have to educate ourselves uh anybody who says anybody who prays to mecca is a muslim our muslim brother and sister full stop and that's all you need to know so the shia are muslim without doubt without any dispute there are some differences between us and them that are filthy differences those are minor there are some differences only five that are major differences uh those do have some impact but that's for the alamed to to discuss and and for the la since the 1950s there's been a long process of reconciliation between the sunnis and shias on those five issues so we look at the shia as an uh uh acknowledged school of thought in which we just have some differences with just like we would look at any of the other non-sunnis like the ibadis like the zadies like the lahiris so on and so forth so education is how we understand this um now there are extreme shia and there are extreme sunnis as well and that's one of the problems and and we reject all of those types of extremisms because our way is the middle way and that is the way of saying the muhammad sallallahu alaihi however this issue about revising you know blm and this i just want to caution us that that we should feel zero pressure from those type of social movements to revise and islam is very clear what it says about race islam is very clear what it says about gender islam is very clear about what it says in sexual orientation and none of that's going to change not not with time not with place not with circumstance because those are clear in the quran there are clear verses there are about gender there are clear verses about hadith about sexual orientation there are clear verses about rooting out racism in our hearts and the prophet saws i'm referring to it as a type of jehelia so on and so forth so we do not we should not feel that we have to carry the baggage of somebody else when our religion has taught us how to deal with those things i don't think that that's what the questioner meant but because the way the question was phrased i wanted to to mention it of course there are different types of shia by the way just to get back to the shia thing the ethno the twelve version are the largest group of the shia and the twelve imams of the shia are our twelve imams as well those are people those are descendants of saddam muhammad saw them and those are from the the pious and the and the pure and we respect and love all of them there are great imams the shia revere them maybe in a way that we do not revere them because some of the shias say or most of the shia might say that they are masoom that they are infallible we do not believe in the infallibility of anyone except the prophet sallallahu alaihi we believe that there are saints and the people are protected but we do not believe in this infallibility such that whatever they say is it is automatically a part of the shitty act but that's something that can be reconciled that's not you know that's not a make it or break it type of situation but we revere the shia as well that we revere the imams as well because these are descendants of rasulullah so i think that again it's education maybe many sunnis don't know that and that's something that we should talk about as for the ahmadis and as i said before if the ahmadis claim and i don't know because i'm not you know in in the know of this but if the ahmedis claim that there is a prophet after satan muhammad saw a prophet that receives revelation a prophet who is infallible a prophet who adds to the sharia then they're outside of islam not because i say so but because they have said so because that's not what the kalima means means the end of the prophet there's no prophecy after that so it's not for me to say if they say that then they themselves have removed themselves from islam if they say that their guy is a good guy a cool guy a much ted or something like that they're muslims but they might have some false beliefs or false notions so it goes back to what they what they say in either case this is a theological debate this has nothing to do with persecution and all that kind of nonsense which is haram our credit cards haram no as long as you pay you buy what you can afford and you pay your bill what is what is our what should our intention be when we do mundane things the sharia in the sharia there are five uh rulings it's not again it's not binary there are other rulings some things are just mobile are permissible some things are mendub some things are recommended so if you're you know brushing your teeth or putting on your clothes you don't have to have a specific intention but if you have a specific intention you will be rewarded for that intention so if you have if you brush your teeth and you say i'm brushing my teeth you know you're saying this subconsciously because it's a sunnah to take care of your teeth you're rewarded let's say you brush like you're rewarded two times say you brush your teeth just to brush your teeth you're rewarded once because you're con you're doing something that is recommended so on and so forth so you don't have to have a specific niya but if you do you will be rewarded multiple times what are the things that break your wadu anything that exits the private parts that's the rule now some things can exit the private parts that would necessitate but that also necessitates will do so the rule or the definition is anything that exits the private parts or if you pass out if you lose consciousness or if you fall asleep what is a pure saint and why do they write a taoise for their students appear my understanding is just the persian word for sheikh maybe i'm wrong but but i understand it is a sheikh a teacher and there are different types of teachers there are teachers that teach you tajweed there are teachers that teach you arabic there are teachers that teach you hadith there are teachers that teach you arithmetic and there are teachers that teach you how to worship allah so when we talk about the pia and the saint we're talking about that latter kind that the sheikh that teaches you how to worship allah subhanahu ta'ala how to root out your negative traits how to arrive at a better relationship between you and allah it's the sheikh of tasawolf it's the sheikh of the tariq uh it's the shaykh of tesca etc so that's what you know and they have to be qualified to do that just like the other teachers have to be qualified to do their things are there false teachers and false peers of course just like there are false you know uh arithmetic teachers and false science teachers and and so on and so forth as far as the taoise the sahaba used to write different dua and verses of the quran that their children would wear so and and there is no prohibition against that so there is a sunnah attached to that so to wear something that has like ayat al-qudzi or allah's name or the prophet's name sallallahu something like that that's all from the realm of of the permissible and for the children you do it for the children for protection maybe they haven't learned how to recite either yet or maybe they haven't learned how to make wudu yet so you want to you know give them that type of spiritual protection that's where it comes from and it has a source in this one somebody said that they made a mistake in the third or the fourth rakah how do they correct it if you are unsure meaning they are unsure how many raka's if you're unsure you go with the lower number and you build so i did i pray three or four when i think like that automatically i say okay i'm gonna go with three and pray one more well what happens if you end up you had prayed for now you've prayed five the allah says that's like extra reward for you so that's how you solve that problem and then the last question i had i see there's a lot on the chat so i'll go to the chat now but a lot of ques the last question i had was about left-handed people eating uh with their left hand and what not eating with the right hand is a sunnah it's not a fart it's not obligatory so allah only bears a soul where they can bear somebody's born left-handed and they're used to doing every the way i'm was born right-handed and that's natural and they can't and that's fine it's not haram allah created you that way the sunnah is to eat with the right when one hand is engaged in eating so i want to go grab something so i go grab it with my right and i eat it and i drink it but if both hands are engaged in the eating and drinking process like i'm holding a fork and knife the prophet saws i'm eight with both hands as well so the issue of only eating with the right is that discussion is when it's only one hand and even then it's a sunnah not a fart okay i see that there are some stuff going on here so let me see how will you all be celebrating 11. you can pass that question okay on the next one uh thank you for pointing out that in a muslim marriage a contract the woman has the first day of an agreement this is another right of women in islam actually yeah i was talking to somebody recently a couple days ago and um [Music] they want me to conduct a nikkei the family uh uh i was explaining this and when i said this that the woman is the one that begins like the mother got very upset she's like that's so odd and it was the first time that i had to to articulate it i said i was like well yeah i mean didn't how did you get married she's like i don't remember my my father took care of it i said well yeah what your father did is he offered your hand in marriage to to your husband and he agreed et cetera and she's like well why that sounds like so barbaric and you could tell like there's like maybe the idea is that the man is the one that proposes maybe it's a cultural thing i said but i and then i i remembered well it's because the woman has to ensure that her rights are protected so she makes the offer she puts the conditions for example a woman can put in the marriage contract that it's stipulated that you can't marry another woman when you're married to me and that can be in the contract because it's a contract you can add things you can add so yeah it's a it's a it's something that most people forget about i want to and there's another question that came in i want to invest in a business that sells coffee smoothies but has some pork products if i donate profit from the pork sales and do not keep it in my income is it permissible i will know exactly how much money is made from the pork sales if you're in the west then that's not haram it's like if you own a grocery store or something like that because the hanafi's allow those type of transactions in non-muslim lands so in that if you're in america or in europe and you've invested in this business and some of that income comes from the selling of the pork which is considered nejis of course and haram for us to consume in that case it would be permissible you don't have to donate that money you mentioned we can pray though and also together can we pray this together as a family and someone lead the prayer yes you can about the truth question can can one have the teeth filled to even out the teeth not filled not for me yeah that's fine there's nothing wrong with teeth feeling rahman shared a document a dropbox document pdf that has 80 of quranic words okay i'll let me click on it but i'll check it out later and that's a good resource for people please clarify if we believe that only prophet muhammad is infallible for all prophets no all of the ambia are infallible i'm sorry if i made it seem that's not the case part of being a prophet is that you are masoom that you are infallible which is why we do not believe that any of the mba committed any sins even though as is narrated in sahih al-bukhari in the discussion of yeoman that some of the mba will come and will not want to intercede because they will think that they had committed a sin like moses will say no i killed the egyptian by mistake and abraham will say i lied because i said that sarah was my sister and so these are not really sins but they they will be so embarrassed from allah except christ when humanity comes to christ christ mentions no sin but he says it's for my brother muhammad sallallahu alaihi anyway we believe in the isma of all of the mba that's part of the package of being a prophet is that you are infallible why because the prophet is delivering the message from allah so how can the prophet deliver this divine message unadulterated but but then be flawed themselves how can you sparse out the you'll start to say oh well maybe the message is corrupted so on and so forth so part of our belief is that all of the mba are are infallible i got the poor question again i think that's just a repeat i've done that the share in the will is prescribed in the quran can one still divide equally to boy and girl and go against what is in the quran only if only if they all agreed so well i said that the bequest is one-third let's say that i want to rearrange all of my will everybody that could and would inherit from me all of them have to agree to that so they all agree you can you can change it why do muslims fight to touch the kaaba because this is the first house created for allah it was in was in mecca and uh you know is you just it's like a magnetic thing you're just like attracted to it you just want to you know you know to touch it for the barakah and and it's spiritual significance for us i mean it's not no other no other reason than that but maybe you're thinking also the black stone to the black stone there's a sunnah to to kiss the black stone as the prophet salallahu sallam did and that's where most of the fighting is or the not only fighting but most of the crowd is for hola does the wife need permission from the husband to carry it out unlike talaq if so what recourse does the woman have to carry at the hola if the man refuses i translated as the woman initiated divorce and it is done through the court system that she she does not need the man's permission um the man can grant the divorce so the talaq is the man divorcing the wife the hula is the wife divorcing the husband in which case the courts are involved there's also an annulment of the marriage in which the court just announced the marriage because something is wrong or something like that so there are different ways again a common misconception is that a man can divorce a wife a woman a woman can divorce a man that's not that's not true they're just called different things and they have different procedures clarify your comment on christ and prophet muhammad in the hadith of um everybody's waiting you know may allah make that that moment easy for us and all of humanity is going are going to the different mbns so adam you know you are the the father of humanity please intercede we want the hour to start we want the judgment to start and adam will say oh i ate from the tree and i'm embarrassed you know to ask allah ask somebody else so then all of humanity will go to ibrahim or they'll go to noah i think and then noah will say but i asked allah to save my son and i was not supposed to do that i'm embarrassed ask somebody else they'll go to abraham abraham will say but i i you know i killed the the man or he'll say i lied uh when the people came back to his town and they said who destroyed all of these idols and he said i don't know ask the big the big idol um uh so i'm embarrassed you ask somebody else so on and so forth until they get to christ but christ mentions no sin he simply says it is for my brother muhammad sallallahu alaihi and that is one of the honors that we have in our faith tradition to jesus is i mean first of all all of those previous mba those are not sins the the the point of the hadith is they were embarrassed because of something that they've done to allah but we do not believe that those were sins at all but it's interesting that in the text of the hadith mentions nothing at all and that's one of the special the the the special rank that we have for sidna issa of course there's no prophet between muhammad sallallahu alaihi that's also one of our beliefs so we have you know we honor all of the mba we don't we don't differentiate between them but this is one of the the special things that we have in our in our tradition towards jesus alaihis if my husband passes away is our retirement account part of the inheritance it depends how the uh it depends how the inheritance it depends how the retirement count is titled there are accounts that can be titled joint tenants in the entirety in which case it's not part of inheritance but then you have a beneficiary and i think it automatically goes i would need to think about about how to i need to learn a little bit more about how they are titled to answer properly but my understanding is that there are beneficiaries are listed and that the the money or the funds automatically go to the beneficiary in that case there's a possibility that it might circumvent the inheritance distribution but i need to think about that can you go over the rules of a male doing what needs to be covered of the aura we'll want to be in a state of we'll do afterwards oh hostas simply just take a bath or a shower so your all of your body including your hair needs to be wet that's it and the the also if you've if you've done the host you also are now in a state of udu that's pretty simple like tala khula have to be done three times i don't think there's going back from the hola i have to review that i think it's a little bit different so i need to look that let me just make a note and then retirement my teenage daughter usually runs errands for me and goes out with friends without a mahram what is your opinion on this there's no prohibition of women going out as long as it's safe so the prohibition or the uh idea that a woman can only go out with a mahram that's if it's not safe then she needs somebody to be with her but can a woman travel theoretically without a mother of course there's nothing wrong with that there's no prohibition against that the prohibition is if it's not safe that's what the idea is now there are there are cultural manifestations that's something different here we're just talking about the quran and the sun okay i believe those are all the questions you
