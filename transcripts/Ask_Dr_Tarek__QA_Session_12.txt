welcome everyone to our open forum um of questions and answers i've received some questions actually the questions this uh this time around are not that many but there are a couple that um are interesting so we'll see we'll see how far we go brother monson had asked me perhaps if we had some extra time to speak a little bit about imam al-ghazari about his biography etc unfortunately i'm traveling at the moment so i'm in a hotel room and i don't really have i'm not able to prepare for that tonight um so we'll answer the questions if some of the my answers are not clear we can follow up um and then maybe with everyone's permission we can delay speaking about imam the next session okay in no particular order the first question is i'm just reading from my phone we read and memorize the quran without understanding the meaning as we don't know the arabic language it means we can't talk to our prophet or angels too in other words in another world and it seems hard for us to learn the language what do you suggest we do well i think it's important that we remember that reading the quran any association of the quran has benefit so whether you read the quran whether you listen to the quran whether you think about the verses of the quran whether you read the tafsir of the quran all of those things are going to have impact all of those things are going to have benefit they'll just have different types of benefit so there should never be a moment where you find yourself not wanting to have a relationship with the quran so anything that you can do with the quran is going to be of benefit you have to that's sort of a first principle that you have to believe in and never never give up on that process as far as conversing with allah and the prophet you can converse with allah and the prophet in your own native language uh that is a relationship that is beyond a specific language so whether it's in your dua or whether it's in your you know your moon or just your calling on allah and the prophet saw this can be in any language and every islamic language arabic farsi urdu turkish malay um all of the major islamic languages and even the minor islamic languages swahili and others they all have their own tradition of poetry or what we call muna is to call upon allah and the prophet saw so there's nothing wrong with with that don't think that because you don't understand the arabic or you're not an arabic speaker somehow you have you can't have a relationship that's not true um as far as what can you do to improve your understanding of the quran is you can read the tafsir there are many tephasir in many languages i think we shared a document not too long ago that can help perhaps if people are very concerned about the issue of the quran maybe what we can do is right before ramadan maybe we can have a special session on on this where i can put together some resources for everyone sorry i'm not sick but i just it's the middle of the night and i know something some dust came in my house okay so i remember now that there's another question related to the quran let me just get that question is listening to the quran as beneficial as reading yes uh listening reading uh looking at the page of the most etc like i said earlier all of those things are a form or or all of those things are a type of relationship with the quran so you now the most beneficial is to have the most in front of you and then you're reading from it so that way your eyes are engaged your ears are engaged your tongue is engaged your hands are engaged because you're holding it that's the but that's optimal that doesn't mean that anything other than that is not good no it just means it's not it's not as it's not full marks you know as that is but listening to the is a very very powerful um a very very powerful tool and as a matter of fact there are many people in the muslim world who have memorized the entire quran simply by just growing up hearing it always recited in the muslim world you'll find many muslim majority countries will have a quran station in which you know the quran is literally playing all day long it's very common in the muslim world that people will have the quran they'll start their day by listening to the quran whether they're a shop owner or a taxi driver or a bus driver or whatever actually it's very common if you go to like a restaurant or something like that early in the morning as they open up the windows and they're cleaning the that's the first thing they do is listen to the quran so listening to the quran is very very important and because we don't live in a muslim majority environment we we sometimes forget that that's something that's important because it's culturally so so common in the muslim majority world so one of the things that we have now that we might have not had before is that we have technology and technology that allows us to listen to the foreign so everyone has a smartphone and anyone can download a free islam uh free app and you can have the quote endless and you can start your day by listening to part of the quran on fridays you can listen to suited calf so on and so forth so all of that is very beneficial and and my my goal is to get everyone to understand the importance of having a relationship with the quran no matter what is there a chat one second i forgot to open the chat box okay can everyone hear me and see me fine define fine okay yeah okay the next question is about yoga yoga is a hindu spiritual practice exercise rather i do it for the last few years is a permissible so yoga is a form of worship that belongs to another religion it's not an exercise it is a form of worship it's a form of ibeda there are different types of yoga but collectively the goal of yoga is to arrive at a oneness with the creator what we call in arabic and which is completely haram it's a completely haram concept because allah subhanahu wa ta'ala cannot be likened to anything allah cannot be placed in anything nor can we be placed in allah so its fundamental belief is something that is quintessentially opposite of tawheed of our talkheed and as a general rule we are not allowed to participate in the acts of worship of another religion now that doesn't mean that all of the things out there in the marketplace that are called yoga are actually yoga a lot of times they're called yoga simply as a marketing tool so if it is an actual hindu practice an actual hindu form of yoga then that would be haram and i know people might not like that that's why maybe there might be some back and forth tonight or on this but if it's a if it's a form of just exercise and somebody has just sort of called it yoga you know as a way of marketing then those those would be okay i've said this before um in the message so this i if people have been with me for with us for a while i hope you realize that this is not something new there are also other forms of islamic mindfulness practices that as a matter of fact i am in the process of developing not that i'm going to have the answers to everything but i am in the process of developing some tools and i hope to share with everyone very soon and there will be some announcements forthcoming uh the message inshaallah in that regard so i don't want people to think that oh but i did this yoga and it helped my back or helped my sleep or there are other exercises that you can do that will have the same effect but will not it will not be knocking on the door of another faith traditions worship one time maybe i don't know 15 years ago or something uh the mufti of egypt at the time who who i was working for he was asked this question and he issued a formal fatwa saying that yoga was haram and it was such a scandal that the indian ambassador to egypt came to the office to meet with him and he was so outraged how could you say that etc etc and it turned out that the reason the ambassador was upset is that he said this is a big economic you know instrument for us we we we have a lot of money in the yoga industry so it wasn't necessarily concerned with the with the religion aspect of it but the economic aspect of it okay we are challenged by our 17 year old daughter she has struggled with aspects of islam and now has taken a boyfriend she has also struggled with following the rules related to phone time and usage we plan to meet with the boy and his parents to talk to them about our boundaries and values in this relationship and also to let them know that we do not approve this relationship but we are only tolerating it so that our daughter does not speak behind our backs what advice do you have for us on how to handle the situation in terms of messaging and boundaries while avoiding the impressions that we approve of this kind of relationship in any way so there are a few things that that come to mind when i read that question the first thing is the daughter has had struggled with aspects of islam so that's something that piqued my interest you know what does that mean what are those problems that she's having with islam can would she be willing to sit down with either me or with a member of and talk about that we all have i have aspects that i find in islam that i have difficulty understanding as a matter of fact i'm here on this trip and i was engaging with one of the um the mufti's that i'm dealing with on my trip and we had a very very strong difference of opinion on on an issue uh and um you know what he said did not sit well with me at all and because i'm a guest i didn't want to make it a big deal and i didn't want to but ever since that you know it was maybe a few days ago or maybe it was last week i've been thinking that i can't stop thinking about that issue and i i keep you know collecting my thoughts and we all struggle with things there's nothing wrong that's one of the joys of life i think is to struggle with something to to to be able to ascertain its beauty and to continue to question it um every time i've questioned islam it's always born fruits for me and my islam is is it seems to me to be very coherent and copacetic with each other and you only i don't i didn't get that way by just accepting what people told me i got that way by critiquing and asking and reading and and spending essentially my whole life on this path of trying to learn so i want to encourage the family or this young girl or or all of us to that we need to ask questions now when you ask questions it doesn't mean that you're going to get the exact answer that you you think you want the question might draw you the question might be incomplete the question might cause you to have more questions the question might cause you to have to do some more research to make more effort to learn so on and so forth so this this is the main part of the question for me there's two main parts that's one part is that the girl has a problem with aspects of islam i'm reading in between the lines therefore it caused her to move a little bit away from her practice of islam in certain aspects so we should welcome her with full arms and and with love and with mercy and and we want to help answer any misconceptions that you have the quran says all you have all our obligation is is to demonstrate and to show people may decide for themselves so our job is to answer those questions and to make sure that people don't have any confusion the other part of the question is that she's 17. she's an adult so as parents as hard as it is you know to say i mean she's not like i mean she's an adult a young adult a young adult let's say i mean i know that she's still at home and still that i didn't mean that she's gone but i meant she's at an age in her life where she needs to make her own decisions and she needs to bear the consequences of those decisions and as somebody who's still connected to the household you know you're supporting her she still has a ways to go with her education that she needs to understand that that support comes with certain very basic and very broad conditions i don't have to support my children in something that i do not agree with if they are old enough to make that decision so if you're old enough to make your own decision and to be independent and to have your own lifestyle then that's the whole package it's not that you can just do that but then i still have to support that or i have to condone that so at some point that conversation has to happen overall when it comes to our children the older that they get i think the more well not no i all the time with our children i think we need to be loving and understanding and forgiving and we need to acknowledge that it's very very difficult the the the world in that we live in is increasingly difficult especially for people of faith especially as people as a minority community the the desire to seek a companion to find somebody from the opposite sex to be with companionship intimacy it's a normal allah created that those feelings within us and allah has also guided us a halal way of doing that and there's a haram way of doing that and we just want to sort of very gently help push our children or or or influence our children towards the right way so i think meeting the boy and his parents so on and so forth so forth is a good idea setting boundaries i think is a good idea and i think you have to just be gentle and and sort of nudge in a gentle way i have a teenage daughter and she is on tick tock most of the time she does not pray she does praise or she does pray and is religious but i fear she will go astray as she is communicating with diverse friends and also engages in fashion and music i keep watch on her on her and track on her cell phone she does not like my spying i do not want her to get disenchanted with me as she will in a few years be going to college so i would not uh i do not condone spying on our children allah says in the quran do not spy upon one another so if your children are young adults they also have the right to have their independence they have to make their own decisions and they have to bear the consequences of those decisions so don't inspire your children unless you think your child is about to harm themselves or something so you know so dramatic that you must interfere but other in almost all circumstances i would say we should not be spying on our children we need to have their trust at the same time you know fashion and music there's nothing haram in in in and of itself in fashion and music i mean who amongst us does not want to to dress well or to dress appropriately or you know and music is just a part of life and it's it's a natural part of life and we've talked about that before there's good music there's bad music there's halal music there's haram music music is a natural phenomenon that allah created these rhythms and and these sounds in in in the world around us it's just a natural thing there's nothing haram it's not a naturally haram thing so getting involved in or listening to music or whatnot is normal this you know the the use of social media is a problem that is it's not just for children or young adults but all of us have this problem because it's a huge waste of time and it can be it's a it's there's an addictive quality to it so rather than hammer away at such a waste of time and and you know the negative i think it would also it's also important that we do it we we balance it with from the other side that we balance our time with also other things so rather than say oh you know i'm so upset from tick tock all the time this and that filling our time or part of our time with something else that's constructive to build positive habits you know reading is very very important and i think it's mark twain her name is mark twain who said something along the lines there is no difference between the illiterate person and the litter person who doesn't read so if you're able to read but you actually don't read you're basically an illiterate uneducated person so allah has created us with this faculty of language and it's it is our greatest tool and as a matter of fact the the faculty of language or the or the technology of language is the one of the secrets behind the message of islam itself because the message of islam is in the quran which whose language is miraculous and in the hadith of the prophet are both preserved in the original language and it's one of the things that islam brought you know to to reinvigorate this importance of language so spending time reading or just doing constructive things you know going out as a family being part of nature so i i find that the better approach is that we have to have balance it's not i'm going to limit your phone usage using a phone track or something like that and that's the only solution it's only going to develop resentment and then when your children leave the house whenever they leave they're just going to resent you even more okay i have another set of questions let me go to that can a wife give a divorce to her husband the the the initiate the wife initiating a divorce is called a talaq divorce is a man divorcing his wife and hola is when the wife asks for the divorce and then she returns the maha to the men and then an annulment is when the court announced the marriage and they all have different conditions and rules and regulations but there is a way that a woman can and i don't know why people don't realize that this idea that women have no rights in the marriage and so forth one of those misconceptions how do you do well is simply reciting different prayers or verses of the quran for those who are sick uh doing them for your children you know when they're young to protect them like before they leave the house there are many many hadith that talk about that there are many verses of the quran that are used so if you look at a book like um the book of remembrance which we have in the masjid you will find a chapter on you know rookia for the sick or roque for your children so on and so forth okay the last question that was sent to me was this most ones say after speaking about the prophet also must one say it after simply thinking about him i find myself having to constantly say it as i think about him quite often and it's becoming a little too much and i feel like i'm committing a sin if i don't the issue is not the issue of haram the issue is the issue of love that we we love and respect the prophet saw sallam the prophet i saw him he said whoever hears my name and does not send salat on me then they are stingy which is a bad thing you know we don't want to be in that so those hadith about saying that sallallahu alaihi sallam after the mentioning of the prophet's name meaning that it's meaning that it's encouraged but it's not wedged it's not an obligation that every single time you hear the prophet's name you obvious but if you don't say salat on the prophet then you are leaving you know we say in business you're leaving money on the table right you're leaving a huge advantage a huge uh korba a huge act of worship a huge you know who amongst us we say that we love the prophet saw how we would cringe to even hear his name and not say but maybe sometimes you're talking about him like i'm giving an answer and i'm mentioning his name so often that i might drop once or twice but i didn't mean to it's just sort of for the flow of the talk or the flow of speech that's fine there's nothing wrong with that as long as one has not left it out of malice that's fine so it's something that is mustahab and something that is encouraged the salaat on the prophet saw is one of the greatest acts of worship it's something that can be done without limit it's something that solves essentially all of one's you know dunya and dean problems so it's something that we definitely want to be involved with okay um there are some questions in the chat how do we differentiate the different types of yoga you can look them up there are different types of yoga that are as i said hindu yoga and there are the things that are just completely made up that are just called yoga because they're just made up i am not an expert in that i would have to if somebody sent me the name of something i could look it up and i could tell you this is you know actual hindu practice or versus this is just a commercial practice my name okay this is a private message i like to draw so my question is can i draw eyes yes you can draw eyes you can draw um the only thing that is haram for us to to do from the image point of view is to create a three-dimensional image a complete three-dimensional image the drawing is fine all language languages are created by allah i believe that therefore in the other world communication with angels and other friends of allah will not be constrained by any language yes actually this is a huge debate amongst the scholars what is the origin of language is language all languages do they come from allah is it one language that came from allah and the differentiation came from man is it that there were some proto-languages that came from allah and then the derivatives came but the majority opinion is that allah is the one who established the boundaries of the language allah taught the name all the names of all things to adam alaihissalam and the proof of that the majority opinion has is that if you look at language if you look at different languages you find many many similarities in the way that we refer to certain words or certain expressions or certain sentence structures so on and so forth even the alphabet and things like that but yes there's no language barrier between you and allah subhana if allah knows your intention if allah knows what's in your heart how can allah not understand you so there's no language barrier a teacher i knew shared with her students to spend time one-on-one with your child no matter how old walk redraw window shop and read one line or two lines of the fun as two worshipers daily helps amy whatever combination works um the the more time you spend with your children when they're young the better because it's going to give you mileage in the future but life can't just be we're watching netflix and we're on our phone it just it can't that can't we were not created to do that at all and it's just we're wasting our life we're wasting our life away there's there's a portion of of the day that needs you know relaxation and unwinding but if we just if that becomes the majority of what we do it's very very scary and the fact that most people don't read anymore or a lot of people don't read it is also very scary too because language and reading opens up so many different worlds to us that are of benefit recently in pakistan we had a tragic incident of an innocent sri lankan man who brutally murdered was brutally murdered by a mob in the name of blasphemy this has led to many people to call for revoking the blasphemy law since those mobs attacked against anonymously become very common i know classic speaks of punishment towards blasphemy but i'm curious how does the shadiad define blasphemy and what is the court procedure to determine the accused is guilty of such a crime well the thing about blasphemy or cursing like allah or the prophet or the religion or or the quran or something like that these are all issues in the sharia that belong to courts they don't belong to individuals so it is the purview of the court and the judge to investigate and there are mitigative uh procedures that can take place at the court for the judge to basically find a loophole maybe the person didn't intend maybe the person didn't understand maybe the person was crazy etc so it's not just that oh i heard somebody say something about the prophet saws so therefore i go and kill him that's that's haram you can't do that because you can't take another life except if it's rightfully taken what does that mean means that they have been found guilty of a capital punishment uh beyond any doubt and therefore the the punishment is carried out other than that you can't just go around killing people in any legal system or our legal system is the same we do have blasphemy laws because these are sacred symbols every single nation every single legal system has sacred symbols they might not be the same as our sacred symbols but there are sacred symbols there are the symbols of the constitution in our culture of the the flag of the united states of america i mean it's considered blasphemous in the secular political uh sense to burn the american flag even though it might be something that's protected by free speech you know we would cringe to even think of doing an act like that we feel like it's like we the language that we would use to be like that's haram why would i do that so every it's a natural thing there are sacred um uh sacred symbols and the desecration of sacred symbols in almost all legal systems often times associated with is capital punishment um i remember one one thing that comes to mind is that when the union troops recaptured new orleans general benjamin butler who was the union general he actually hung several people for desecrating the american flag because they were you know they wanted to fly the confederate flag but it was recaptured so on and so forth so these things exist it's not like it doesn't exist but i mean that's an extreme example because he was an extreme general but the my point is is that it's not like something that doesn't exist except in islam no it exists across the board but it's something that belongs to the courts and if it belongs to the courts and if it's something that continually it continues to happen like i'm a judge and then every week i get 50 blasphemy cases something's wrong blasphemy's not something that happens with that kind of frequency so therefore the issue is what's going is it really blasphemy to start out with i've had people at the mosque come to me with blasphemy issues and say oh my distant cousin or i have a relative back in this country or that country and they're they're in hiding because they blasphemed against the prophet sasebo so what did they say about the prophet so they told me well that's not blasphemy that's just that's just incorrect information so also i have found that that muslims have and oftentimes they don't know what blasphemy means or is and they think that anything that they might misconstrue as negative negative statement towards the prophet sasam is a blasphemy we have to have some tolerance people have misconceptions about islam we have an obligation to teach them so on and so forth can you more deeply explain the meaning of salawat on the prophet sallallahu alaihi muhammad is to ask allah's prayers and blessings upon the prophet and this is an act that allah himself the angel sending prayers on the prophet sasam is a form of dua ours our salawat or our asking of allah to send prayers on the prophet sasan also a form of dua because the prophet isaiah is the there is nothing in the created world that is greater than rasulullah and the enormity of the prophet islam and the sanctity of the prophet is without bounds it is something that that you cannot exhaust how how much you talk about it or how much you praise it or how much you emphasize it because it is the quintessential reality that this religion has come in addition to tawheed has come to teach humanity so because of the enormity of that because of the greatness of the prophet when you engage in that act an act that allah himself engages in it brings with it all of this reward that when you when you pray when you do salawat on the prophet saw allah prays for you ten times we do say a lot on the prophet forbids your skin from being touched by the hellfire when you do salawat on the prophet solves or it's enough for you in other words you have to you don't have to engage in any other extra spiritual work works other than your basic five prayers a day in ramadan and zakah and hajj so there are all of these hadith extended to talk about the greatness of the act of the salawat of the prophet but spiritually what's happening is that you are attaching yourself to greatness you are attaching yourself to beauty you are attaching yourself to perfection the prophet saws and insane came and he is the perfect human being he has the perfect embodiment of what a human being can and can achieve of course he achieved that through the will of allah and through uh the purification process of prophethood etcetera i mean we can't necessarily get to that level but he is an example of perfection so the prophet is not a hero heroes are from amongst us that overcome their doubt and overcome their demons and you know they're heroic the prophet saws is an archetype he is a is a form of beauty and perfection he is the definition of beauty and perfection so to do salawat on the prophet salaam is to attach yourself to that and is to bring those meanings closer to you can we send salawat on the prophet sasam and his family campaigns while i'm laying in bed to go to sleep it relaxes me but i'm being told that no you can do it no matter what in any there's there's no mode in your life in which you can there's no way there's nothing that you can say in that question there's no way you can do it that would make me say you can't do it that way it's something that's open-ended as a matter of fact the salawat on the prophet is accepted even from the non-muslim and some of the traditions that we have if a non-muslim were to say you know you know god said prayers on muhammad saw they would count for them and they would be rewarded for it that's how great the act is no so there's nothing that can there's nothing that should stop you ever from reading quran and there should there should never be anything you do that stops you from to making zikr or salawat on the prophet because those are other than reading quran of which salawat is a part there are no preconditions to it there are no limits to it remember allah often night and day so there are no preconditions or prerequisites to that [Music] um oh man did i lose the chat box okay there it is given that allah has sent prior prophets with prior traditions that all preach the single message of tawheed how do you reconcile that in one tradition saturday is considered holy alcohol is permissible another sunday's hole in eating pork is permissible when islam friday is holy eating pork and drinking alcohol or both haram this won't just chalk it off to maine man-made changes to prior tradition that the shariah was different so the the message of tawheed there are two things that all of the the messages before us have one of them is to hate and the other one is that every single prophet mentioned to their people that at the end of time there will be a prophet that will seal this lineage of prophet prophecy satan muhammad sallallahu alaihi but other than that the sharia itself changes the sharia changes throughout time and that is allah's purview so this is not necessarily there are man-made stuff that comes later of course that's part of it but the sharia just was different so um there are dietary things that change with the sharia there are abadet that changed or the frequency of about that the change was uh with the sharia so that's something different the the tawheed or the theology of the religion is the same or the core of it is the same but the way that you practice that theology that has changed with the different revelations are there any other questions so just while people are if want to think of asking questions just i wanted to mention something which is that inshallah in sha allah i should be coming back home um exactly a month from now uh the week of january the 10th so if it's okay with everybody i would like us to do the next uh ask tariq session when i'm back uh so we can do it at the masjid if that's okay with everyone i i i still haven't purchased my ticket yet i i'm like as i said i'm traveling right now i'm going back to cairo uh thursday so next weekend i'll buy my ticket inshaallah and i'll let brother marseille and remember to fight everyone just as i'm rude to know my dates and once we have those dates if it's okay if we can i know that we we usually do this the first tuesday of every month the first tuesday of january is january 4th which will be i don't know maybe so people are still on holiday and because i'll be around the next week if it's okay if we do that that's one thing i wanted to mention and there'll be other things that we'll do in the message like friday prayers and the class and all of that um so i just wanted to mention that inshallah and um well we can figure out the the christmas holiday time off on the sunday class i guess we can do that next week or i'll i'll talk to brother mawson or emember 5 about that we can figure that out later any other questions class will still be on zoom yeah when i have the message we do things on zoom um the my class the sunday class will i'll if i'm at the mosque we'll have i'll have my ipad we'll be on zoom if we add the asktaric session will be on zoom if i'm not mistaken the drama is still on zoom yeah so we still have that don't worry or maybe we should not do it on zoom and just make everyone come to the mosque and charge everyone 50 for entrance no i'm just kidding we're always going to do what we can to make sure that our content and our you know services are for everyone you know that and i'm sure there are people on this call right now that are from all over the world i mean i'm in i'm in jordan and i'm man jordan brother martin is in sri lanka i mean there's probably somewhere else we have families that join us every week from singapore so alhamdulillah you know i don't think we're going to stop that um at all hindu yoga invokes which is a hindu prayer what if we say zikr like instead of saying omo that's the problem so the problem is that we're gonna we're gonna create like the syncretic um the syncretic act that will that could lead to um you know spiritual confusion my suggestion is that we we engage there are other exercises i i'm not a the problem is i'm not very well versed in these things so i'm i i hate to say oh don't do this then i don't have an alternative so this is one of those cases where unfortunately that's what i'm saying but there are there are alternatives there are other practices and exercises and you know like tai chi and there are other oriental things the eight what is its eight something circle or china there's there are other exercises that you can do that are simply just exercises they're not tied to some kind of thicker or they're not tied to some kind of religious practice and those are the ones that i encourage and those are the ones that i know that many muslims who who are into that engage in and those are fine but yoga specifically because of its it is a look look at the wikipedia entry of yoga you will see what i'm you know it is an act of worship is a form of ibeda so you could tweak things from it if you didn't call it yoga and you know you didn't do the own thing of course um there are ways to tweak it of course and as a matter of fact that's what our ancestors did you know our ancestors inherited all of this stuff from it it's not like our ancestors didn't know about yoga or didn't know about ancient egyptian religion and language or didn't know about about buddhism or they knew these things they inherited these things from the ancient world or greek and roman philosophy or literature they knew these things and the the sufis of islam they took these things in in addition to what the quran and sunnah teaches us and they develop their own practices so we have our own practices the point is is to revive them and and to reinvigorate them so that we we have something that's more native to us so there are ways of i'm not i don't want it to seem like it's black or white it's not black or white but we are not allowed to engage in another form of worship another form of iberos is what i'm saying but there are ways to tweak it for sure yoga is meditation too it's a type of meditation yeah but it's a meditation that leads to a belief that is not consistent with tawhid which is which is union between you and allah subhanahu wa time and that is not possible according to yoga and strong oh god according to yoga instructions they teach to pick a word that allows one to breathe easily and not move focus from their mind and heart further they profess to be mindful about what one chooses in other words the actual word is irrelevant to the yoga itself not to real yoga that's that's the commercial yoga but into real yoga it matters it matters what you say it matters what chakra you're focusing on unlocking you know all the way no that's that that stuff right there that's that's american yoga that's mcdonald's yoga and that's why i'm saying there are there are things out there that are not yoga they're just called yoga because they are considered to it's to sell or as a commercial product but yoga yoga textbook definition of yoga no that's not true it doesn't matter what you say because it is an ipad that's an action it's like me saying you can do this prayer you know but you can instead of saying the fat and whatnot you can you know just hum your favorite bon jovi song and i just call it prayer and then it's going to make you happy and i just make it up you know it's an american way so there are things out there like that like the sweat yoga or whatever it's called uh beckham bikram yoga that guy that was arrested so there are stuff like that in regards to our private message in in regards to the question about the the young girl the boyfriend etc i mean this is a private message so i won't necessarily read it but um my suggestion is that uh why don't we make an appointment that you she can come by the message when i'm there in january and we can just have a friendly we can just have coffee and tea it's a friendly conversation um when you want to engage with our children and they're older um we don't also want to put pressure on them we don't want them to make them feel like oh we're so disappointed in you you need to go to speak with the imam or you need to go speak to a counselor or a psychologist or something like that i mean imagine you being on the receiving end of that you're not going to be so happy every time you think about your parents and culture and religion it's going to be like this big black box so just a friendly conversation why don't we just start or a zoom a zoom call friendly just a friendly conversation just sort of would you like to ask anything or how's it going or you know how school going and what are you planning next so on and so forth just non-judgmental not pressure just to get the engagement going is it okay to use a 3d printer in general yeah but if you're going to make a gun and go kill people that's your school that's haram so the idea of using a 3g pinterest fine but it depends what you use it for or if you're gonna make steel like some companies i don't know packaging and sell it as your own i mean there are so there can be haram uses some uses but the concept of using a 3d printer is nothing wrong with that okay so i'll see everybody soon inshallah a class will resume on sunday uh sorry i had to cancel classes last time i had a meeting at that time i just was not able to to accommodate the class time uh but moving forward things should just be smooth inshallah um do you want to say anything else but if i did you did you wanna i see you you popped up on the screen did you wanna say something uh no i just wanted to earlier you had mentioned about the about sunday over the christmas break so just to let everyone know that for that one sunday i think we're going to be off which is like the
