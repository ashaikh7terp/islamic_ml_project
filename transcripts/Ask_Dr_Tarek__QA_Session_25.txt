welcome back everyone to our open Q&A session we ask Allah subhana T to bless this Gathering inshallah may it be a gathering of knowledge such that the Angels cover us with their mercy and may this testify for us on our behalf insh tonight we have quite a few questions uh by my counting we have 5 questions I might not be able to get to all of them because some of them I want to be I don't want to be rushed through answering them so if we cannot finish all the questions I will Mark the ones that uh I have not completed and we'll we'll add those to the next one inshallah okay and again these are Anonymous so I'm in just the order that I received them uh somebody says that I have mentioned previously that combining prayers and is permitted without reason within the I have heard this opinion with some relatives shared this opinion with some relatives and they wondered if they could combine regularly out of convenience or if it is permitted only on an occasional basis could you please advise as I said this is a Hadith is narrated in Muslim by the by that the prophet sallallah alai wasallam combined and in Medina for no reason and in the narrations in the mus of IM Ahmed of that same Hadith they asked him why and he's IB abas said so the there would be no difficulty for my um so this is a dispensation that we have and as a matter of fact this is how the Shia pray the Shia pray five prayers a day but three times a day and they combine and so there is a for that there's a there's a there's a a source for that in our Dean that that makes sense so yes you can follow this dispensation especially if you live in the west uh because the distances here are very far the availability of finding a mosque or place to make woodoo or a safe place to pray is not that easy so if you want to continually do this living in the west it's fine if you live in the Muslim world then one would say you can follow it but not out of a habit so you wouldn't do it habitually because there are mosques everywhere and places to pray everywhere um somebody's asking about some of the questions are very long so I'm going to sum somebody's asking about the 529 education saving plans um uh and about zaka on them there is no zaka on the 529 plans because you're saving this for the purposes of uh education and in the Hani maab they allow if you um if you isolate a certain amount of funds for needs like so my children can get married or in this case for education then you don't have to pay zaka on that amount if you don't pay that money towards your children's education and then you take the money you withdraw the money and you pay the penalty if the money that after you withdrawn it if that is above the nisab then you're going to pay zaka on that that's a different situation but we're just assuming that you're putting money into the plan for the purposes of education and then you uh spend down that money for your children's education there's no zaka on that someone gave my newborn son gold jewelry as a gift since it is not permissible for boys can I sell it or have my wife buy it from her for herself and give him cash um that sounds sounds like somebody's like trying to circumvent paying zaka so first of all if your son was giving je it's very common Even in our culture we give gold coins and things like that so somebody gives your son gold jewelry okay your son can't uh wear the jewelry but your son can own the jewelry so you can own a man can own jewelry for the purposes if it's gold for example for investment or something like that in that case because it is not lawful for us to have gold jewelry I would pay zaka on that if that was mine so in this case you can either have your son retain the money and then you would just pay the zakat on that or you could sell it and convert into cash or and you're free to do with it what you want but I don't want somebody to assume because men can't wear gold jewelry somehow uh we can't have something gold those are two different things I mean have you ever been to a jewelry store like in the Middle East now they're all men are in the jewelry store you know and they're like holding all of the the they're selling to our wives and things like that that's fine the man owns a a jewelry store and that's his inventory there's nothing wrong with that it just has different zaka implications okay if we agree for a cab to come the next day for a certain price or we agree that someone came to fix our AC the next day at a certain price and then while he is on his way we cancel because we don't need that anymore is there a sin and breach of contract no there's no breach of contracts because we are the prophet Sall wasallam said that as long as we are in the phase of the contract we have the right to resend the contract both the buyer and the seller so this is part of contract law is it a low blow yeah it's a low blow it's not nice to do that to somebody because they've you know they've taken it upon themselves to come sometimes there'll be a cancellation fee or something like that to accommodate it but you know situations happen and if you don't need it that's fine there's no sin involved in that nor is there a breach of contract it's just not cool you know it's not a nice thing to do to somebody who has made a plan but you know it happens Muhammad okay somebody's asking about saying that we wear suits to work first of all I don't know who wears suits to work anymore but I'll just go with the question we still wear a suit to work okay alhamdulillah maybe maybe I'm I'm divulging too much of my own private life there are those of us who wear suits to work it becomes very difficult to clean Nessa out of the suits which we can't put in the washing machine or which are damaged by water the same for ladies dresses it's not a usual occurr turns but sometimes it happens that nesa gets on these clothes I heard there's a f that allows dry cleaning to clean nesa can we follow this I don't know anything about this hanafi position but let me just address the issue of NASA NASA is uh um religiously uh stip or religiously identified filth in in other words not everything that that we consider filthy is n so NASA is uh urine feces blood uh anything else is just dirt maybe we are upset that it's on our body but it's not n it's not NASA is a Shar definition so when somebody says I have NASA on my suit I have a lot of questions does that mean you have feces and urine and blood on your suit that's so I just want people to understand that question anyway let's just go with the the the the the the verbiage of the question n it's an obligation for us to remove the nesa but the nesa can be removed in multiple ways so if there's dry nesa you could just move it away and then it's removed if it's wet nesa then you have to remove it usually by water but by other means as long as the color and the smell and the texture of that which is NES is no longer on the body part the only thing that we have to use water for is for the saliva of a dog and a pig in the four mabs in the shaf in the Hani and the h as for imik he he deemed all living creatures to be pure and therefore he did not see that Hadith as something that is obligatory had another interpretation of that Hadith so if I'm wearing a suit or my juba that I wear in jum it's the same material wool I can't wash that with water it will water will ruin it so if I was in a place for example and a dog came and licked me I would have to follow the position of Imam Malik because if I didn't follow that position I would have to was it seven times one time with the Earth and that would ruin it completely so the the the first thing to note is that NASA needs to be removed and as long as we remove it its Trace its color it smell its texture ET Etc we're fine the only thing that requires water is the saliva of a dog and a pig and you know the rest of the things might be there might be things that we do not like like Snot or something like that um those things bother us or food fell on me but that's not considered NES that's just considered dirt so there's a difference in the between the definition and I hope that that helps as far as the f I don't know about that I would have to look into it I didn't have a chance to look into it before uh tonight's session yes that's the that's the best way to do it and even if you had the you know these kind of clothes if you you know use a little bit of water or or sparkling water and you tapped it and dabbed it you can do it in a way that doesn't ruin the material all right a stepfather as a stepfather can you be a Maham of your stepdaughter for Haj or om also what is your financial responsibility after your death for your stepdaughter that can be put in part of the will if you marry a woman and you consummate the marriage then then you are a permanent Maham for her children and vice versa so you are her Mah you know that verse in the Quran so you are M uh for Haj and for om and for all other things uh as far as financial responsibility after death you can put her in the will through a you can give a bequest and the was for us is up to oneir the Prophet Sall wasallam said so uh the determined that you can bequest one up to one3 of your uh your estate to whoever you want up to oneir without permission of the inheritors if you want to give more than oneir then you have to take permission of the all the inheritors is it considered Haram to have a credit card and borrow money even if you pay off the balance every month and do not acre interest on the balance are the points cash rewards given from the credit card companies considered as receiving riba well of course you can use a credit card but when you say borrow money I'm not if you mean you want to borrow money from the credit card and pay that back with interest that's Haram uh because that's a debt that is not backed by uh an asset however I think the questioner means you pay you use your credit card throughout the month and then you pay the bill in full before the deadline if that's what you're doing that's fine because the credit card is a form OFA it's a form of deputizing somebody to buy on your behalf like if I gave IM some money and said can you go buy me from the bookstore 123 that's what the credit card compan you're deputizing the credit card company to make the purchase on your behalf as far as the points and rewards and cash that's fine uh inshallah that's not RBA and that and that has to do with the you know the the status of of paper money not having GBA in it which is the shaf opinion that's fine if I'm using the credit card throughout the month and then I get the bill and I pay the bill in full that's fine if I borrow money with a student loan or Home Mortgage without knowing it was Haram besides paying the loans off as soon as possible is there anything else I need to do to get the sin forgiven besides making Dua to Allah subhana tala well taking out a home mortgage and a student loan is not Haram so that's the first thing to say about the question the home mortgage and any type the Home Mortgage we don't consider it to be a loan we consider to be finance a tam so a debt a is different than a debt or taking a loan is different than Finance if the uh if the money that is taken is to finance an asset house property whatever then that is a Halal transaction as far as the student loans are concerned of course there's no asset but an education is considered a it's considered a necessity and therefore we allow this type of transaction out of necessity so inshallah the the money that you took is is halal and uh you have incurred no sin inshallah is investing in my provided 401K Haram no it's investment for your future there's nothing wrong with that what rewards if anyone gets when he or she does Hajj on behalf of somebody else well inshallah you get the reward of the Hajj for doing it and then your sins are forgiven in addition to the person on whose behalf you made the Hajj it also receives that reward of course the the condition of that is that you have have to have made Hajj for yourself first so you have to fulfill your personal obligation and then you can make Hajj for whomever can one do or Hajj if the person has not done the pilgrimage before well Hajj is the pilgrimage I mean yes you can do om in the the OM is a obligation to do once in your life like the Hajj and you can do omah because the time of Hajj is it's tight right the time of Haj is from the the first day of sha the first day of until the 9th of those are those are the the months of Haj and it's limited so let's say outside of that you know seven eight months outside of that you have the opportunity to go to make pilgrimage you're going to go and make it's just out of a function of time that's the time that you have to to go so inshallah that's that's fine and we ask Allah T to write for us all inshallah insh okay somebody's asking like here in the mosque if somebody loses their woodo and you know we have like a big function or the you know it's Friday prayer or something like that and it's crowded um Can somebody do T in general no if you are in a place that has water you have to make woodo with the water even if you if if it's inconvenience and at this mosque we try our best you know to make the bathrooms accessible we have bathrooms Upstairs Downstairs and in the new building we have multiple bathroom facilities inshallah there is some dispensation in the Maliki maab if you come to prayer late and if you're going to make the prayer uh if you're going to miss the Prayer by going to make W you can make tum so if you go into North African mosques where the Maliki maab is predominant you will find that they have Stones all throughout the mosque because you can make tum on the stone so there is a dispensation for that but it's only one one position and in the other if you make in a place in which normally water is then after that prayer you have to make up that prayer with wo why because tum is less strong than wo so wo the definition of Woo is the act that allows you to pray uh with its full conditions does not sorry wo is the act which lifts the state of impurity does not lift the state of impurity it simply allows you to pray it's a definition so it's less than less than W so if we're in the mosque right now and the the water is cut off for whatever reason now this is a place usually where there is water but now there's no water we will all have to make tum and pray but because this is a place in which there usually is water we have to make up that prayer when we go back home or when the water comes back with wo why because tum does not does not raise from you the state of impurity the way water does with the woodoo but if we are in a place if we're traveling or we're out in a place in which there is no water normally and we run out of water we packed water with us then you can make tum and then that prayer does not need to be made again so because of that if this is the scenario if you're in the mosque and you lose your woodoo go make uh woodoo in the bathroom can you repeat the guidance you provided for marriage between a non-muslim and a Muslim well I mean it's not guidance it's just what the Sharia teaches us is that uh a Muslim woman can only marry a Muslim man and for Imam abuan a Muslim man can marry a can marry a Jew or a Christian only not other people ofab as a concept is any pre-islamic organized religion but within not all of the receive the same rulings in Islam so we only eat the of of the meaning the Jews and the Christians not the food of like the arasan and the Hindus or something like that so when it comes to marriage of a here in this context we only mean the Jews and Christians as far as coexistence and non-muslim minorities and Muslim lands and things like that we deal with all of those people the way we deal with zorran Hindus Buddhist shintu confucious so on and so forth all of them that's a different category that's from the point of view of coexistence when it comes to marriage IM Abu allowed that the other M don't and that's a little bit of a surprise for some people but in the shf we don't allow a Muslim man to marry outside to marry a because the sh argue that what was meant was the original people the original people of the book at the time of the message of the Prophet sallallah alaih wasallam anyway that being the case um marriage in general is something that is always legislated by religion every religion they legislate their own form of of marriage of course today people want to just do it civil and and want to have a personal choice that's that's an Aber bareny that's not how it has been historically historically marriage has always been something that's been regulated by religion and all Orthodox religions do not allow their people to marry outside of the faith this is all all just a modern type of situation and in that regard we are no different and that's really you know that's there's not much more for me to say about that well if they convert then they're Muslims so it's might goes both ways only only IM Abu hanifah allows that the other M don't allow that now of course if somebody converts and they convert and then we take the conversion as real we don't assume anything so that's obviously another that's another scenario altogether if a marriage happened in Bangladesh can a divorce be filed in the US and vice versa does the Sharia have a ruling on this yes because the as long we are following the Sharia parameters for both marriage and divorce so if you're married in Bangladesh or Timbuktu or Ottawa or California and you follow the there's a and there's the Mahar and the the verbi then married doesn't matter where you go you're married uh and likewise if there is a correct divorce pronouncement then you are divorced it doesn't matter where you go you might need to file certain civil documents to certify the marriage and the divorce but that's secondary but for us the marriage is what takes place verbally and the divorce is what takes place verbally and what is written down from a civil point of view simply certifies what has already taken place yes this is by IM this is by consensus yes I've seen a lot oh thank you so much a Muslim woman cannot marry a non-muslim man by consensus sunnis Shia the old Muslims the new Muslims Easter every sect every group of Islam has consens is one of the few things that everyone agrees to so if they if they get married and I'm not allowed to go to their ceremony because I feel like this is a Haram thing that they have no that's a separate issue that's uh cuz I've seen a lot of Muslim woman these days they marry um yeah it happens yeah okay thank you if I find a perspective partner for marriage in college is it a sin to meet often until we are sure yeah as long as your parents know and that it's you know done out in the open then that would be fine you know with with what is right and what is you know considered for us proprietary uh you're not going to hide from him obviously or her you're going to see them around campus and whatnot so that's fine as long as the parents know and it's above board in recent times there have been sad incidences where drug addiction and availability of marijuana has resulted in death suicide and the counseling work that you and imami provide what is your guidance to parents as to to tackle this at home from a religious point of view and are there special duas that a parent can ask well in general any Dua that we make for our children is is one of the accepted Dua so we should always pray for our children and we should always be optimistic in Allah subhana wa tala answering our Dua for our children as far as you know guidance I mean unfortunately the problem with drugs is there's a social component and then there's also a component of addiction when it becomes an addiction then there becomes a chemical dependency on the drug and there's very little that I or IM can do other than to refer you to an expert to help you solve the addiction you might have the desire to stop and to quit but it's an addiction it's an illness and it's a sickness and a disease and therefore it needs to be treated in in that way but what we can do is maybe help before it gets in before it gets to the point in where it's an addiction and I think that that's one of the problems that I notice is that I feel people come to us too late you know they come to us and they expect us to fix all of the problems whereas I think we're supposed to come involved in the beginning not at the end because at the end you need somebody as I said who's going to be specifically able to deal with these type of things however you know I think it's important that we provide uh venues and opportunities for our children uh to release their stress and uh their energy and uh you know there's physical exercise there's Sports there's after school activities there the activities that we provide at the mosque of course we can can always do more we're trying to do more but you know being busy and being involved and and leading an active life in in things that build on each other is the better is the better best way to the rush and the thrill that you're going to achieve receive from achieving these goals is going to be greater than the Russ and and the high that you're going to have from drugs which is just chemically induced and very temporary so we have to create the space where the children can get involved with these type of things as far as suicide I mean suicide is the is the same thing you know there's a suicide hotline and the people can be involved uh often times depression is involved and depression can also be a chemical situation or chemical needs chemical attention and Medicine involved so we we are happy to help but we have to also you know blessed is the person who knows the limits of of their own limits so there's only so much we can do if something is so progressed then there's very little we can do other than guide you to the experts that can uh help in that matter um May I add that this has now become a very serious issue in our community even in the Washington greater Washington area so your point about creating the space and being proactive uh in the masjids and the imams can use that space that opportunity to have the Bas their kabas alas particularly theas I would say a series over a period of time might be very helpful to raise the awareness uh and in addition maybe a special session or two over here where we invite professionals like the psychiatrists and counselors to come in because imams themselves may not have the techniques to address this and we could probably have a series of events like this in the fall because this is we've had instances here in the last several months of all those points that this question here uh has raised I mean of course all all of the above uh all of the above we need to do and more and I think it comes down to um there's a our children are under a lot of peer pressure at school and in their friends group and as a minority Community it's sometimes doubly hard and the mosque has to be that safety valve where we come and we are comfortable and we can explore and we can have fun and we can learn and we can grow all of us together but if the mosque is like a restrictive area where everything is Haram and Halal and we only pray and you know it's it's just one one like a monologue it's just like me or if I pray preaching and that's it's there's no dialogue involved in it then we've missed the mark because the the mosque is supposed to be much more from that if there's so much pressure out there then this has to be the place where people have their pressure you know it's a it's a safety valve and the they feel comfortable and they're happy and they long to come alhamdulillah we've you know in general I think many people share that sentiment specifically with our mosque that they enjoy coming to the mosque and uh and participating and even you know like in the nights of Ramadan we never go outside and ask the kids to come and pray not once have we ever done that we just just come to the mosque just come and play basketball after a you or play play basketball all night long we're fine you don't have to come inside and listen to anything or pray just be here with us and have a good time and it worked and I know there are a lot of families that say you know our kids bring us to the mosque because they love coming and and I think that we have to be more open to that all of the above and if the problem is you know growing then we have to grow and rise to to meet the problem to meet that challenge inshallah or else we will be derel in our duty so I guess something is going to come down as a result of that inshallah very soon um if a person falls sick can Sak be a Healer yes the prophet sallam said heal your sick with sodak and many many stories of people that were sick and then you they give sodak and you know the sickness is relieved uh many many stories from the salaf and you know the saintly people and so on and so forth so yes giving s is a form of healing a form of purifying the money alhamdulillah what are the essential rules for the delivery of the J the J there needs to be the introduction uh in which Allah T is praised and the Shah is recited and there's a general admonition of being having tawa and that that part has to be done in Arabic so you know bis ald I mean it could be as short as that and then you sit down and then you stand up and then you say and then you pray that's that that's that's J that's it so there's twas you sit in the middle and in the beginning you you do the things that I just said and then the actual sermon part can be done in in any native language of course there are differences of opinion but you know of the opinions that allow the to be not not in Arabic that's the minimal the minimal out some people are stuck with this position the Hani position that you the has to be in Arabic so what they do is they give aay so somebody stands and they speak in the native language and then either that person or somebody else will come and do the actual all in Arabic and many times they memorize arabicas that are like from the medieval period and they're like praying for sulan and the Dua and you know people that have passed away and it's very funny sometimes in Kenya and one of the most I went to they made me do that they said you have to give the Bayan in English and then you have to get on the mimar and do the in Arabic but that's just one position for Muslim minority communities that opinion is not the most compatible opinion but the the more compatible opinion is that you do the minimal amount that you have to do in Arabic and then you stand sit stand the second Dua and that's it and then you pray that's all you have to do for like the day when the AC was broken and I had to give theba I gave a very short along those lines um I wanted to say something else about the in the shaf you have to have a minimum of 40 people that's correct including the but I mean I don't I would not I don't I don't announce that part because if you if you said that people would stop coming to jamaa so because there are other opinions of course um so we should have druma no matter what yeah it's three actually in the books of they'll say they're like over 19 opinions about how the minimal amount some one opinion says it's just the and someone to listen to the so and sometimes when I give the everyone's asleep I really feel like there's only one person that's listening to me if if anyone but anyway that's another issue but um we should definitely have Juma no matter what because if that's a slippery slope we should have Juma no matter what and like I said the minimal amount is the minimal amount of course a condition of Juma I should also mention is that you have to have permission to have Juma but as American citizens we are the permission is granted to us by the Constitution itself so in in in in a country not like the United States there actually you have to actually go through some kind of even if it's ceremonial uh like a license or um you know that it has to be like a legit you can't just show up on the corner and jum because you have to have government per permission to do the Juma um so in other Muslim minority countries that is actually a concern uh they have to get licens and things like that but for us we have you know this is obviously as we know our constitutional right so we're duly constituted mosque and and therefore our Juma is valid all of our M our Juma is valid inshah is the sum yeah yeah I don't follow that's fine I mean because sometime I mean I have been in those Mass where the guy is droning on in Arabic and no one understands and it's like a memorized from the 13th century so it might be a sound you know there are many many of our opinions in our are sound may be Sounder than like as you said than the other ones but there's it's not like necessarily applicable and that's why alhamdulillah we have the plurality of you know to choose and what about the Dua in other languages the the Dua can be in English it doesn't have to be in Arabic other du in the Salah in the Salah you can make Dua in any language but that would be silent like when you're in suud or something like that but the Dua of the that has to be done in Arabic in the prayer after that that's fine you can do any language is fine yeah maybe we can have like a workshop or something for the Juma I guess if to train people that might not be a bad idea um man I'm not even halfway okay uh I do not know how to read Arabic can I read the Quran using English transliteration of course I do know the fat and a few suras by heart when I pray of course that's fine the transliteration is fine you can read the translation you can listen to the Quran do anything that gives you a relationship with the Quran don't ever conclude therefore I can't touch the Quran therefore I can't read the Quran if you do that then something's gone wrong in your thinking that's like one of the the the plays that shaan has he's going to try to make us not pick up the Quran so pick up the Quran read the translation read the transliteration have a relationship with the Quran and the Quran will have a relationship with you um if a person passes away what are the rules of how soon the burial can take place some send the body overseas which takes days will the soul be affected by the delays caused by the family you know as we say so the we honor the deceased by burying the deceased as soon as possible so the the the washing of the body the janza prayer and the burial should all be taken place as soon as is possible now bodies that are shipped overseas sometimes that happens because somebody's not a citizen or a resident and therefore there are laws and sometimes they have to be shipped overseas of course out of necessity that's fine but the idea that somebody dies in the family and we're going to hold everything because we got to bring everybody together that's not our way that's not our Sunnah because remember the the the focus here is on the person who has died not on us and how we feel we feel bad and the family feels bad but waiting is not in the best interest of the deceased it makes us feel better but that's not the secondary or or tertiary the primary focus is to make sure that this person that has passed away it's now a communal obligation it's a we have to do it as a community to make sure that the body is washed properly shrouded prayed upon and buried according to the Sunnah you on the right side facing the and uh you know that's how we honor the deceased just like when we die when I die do that for me please you know bury me in the backyard here as soon as possible inshallah and I'll always keep a watchful eye on I CCP insh so of course the Sunnah is to bury in the earth But there again there are every state or maybe now it's every County I think it's a state thing there are state regulations so sometime in our state or in our County we have the cement uh coffin inside but it's huge so grave liner sophisticate the lawyer the grave liner so the grave liner is very big so that is the grave the grave liner is the grave so we just put the dirt around the body when we put the gra the body inside and we we tilt it towards the right um putting the body directly inside the grave liner that would be optimal uh but if if uh a couple of funerals we've had the box has gone in and I think it's almost like a regulation thing has I don't know if it's changed or uh because they don't it's messy to get yeah okay I see in in the case in when we have the the casket in side we open the casket and we fill the casket with Earth I mean it's all permissible it's not like but what's better is to put the body in earth as a matter of fact the Sunnah is not even that the Sunnah is called Al is when you dig down and to the side and then you put the body in the side that's how was buried to bury straight down is called a sh that's the way we do it here but the sunah is a yeah so that's but I mean obviously we don't do that here so I'm just saying all of these things are uh are by necessity they're permissible in Egypt it's even more freaky in Egypt we don't do either of these things each family has a plot and it's a room under the ground with steps and this room is for men and this room is for women and every time somebody dies we open it up and we go down and we we lay the body down because the water table is so high in Egypt we can't have an individual it's very very I mean I've had to do it I've had to go down I've had to dig my grandfather and my my grandmother and bury them somewhere else cuz the road is expanding it's very traumatic thing so all of these things are by necessity so sometimes we we get some leniency but we try to surround the body with Earth as much as possible that's what matters and as to come back to the question to do this as soon as possible you know as soon as realistic because for example we can't bury somebody at night we have to bury we have to bury during the day so sometimes somebody dies so we have to wait a day or two or a couple we' had a couple of deaths when it was freezing absolutely like 15° Fahrenheit or something so we have to wait for the because the ground is frozen so these type of delays are okay inshallah yeah in war time you know in war time you can pray you know that's that's all you don't you don't have to make it up because it's it's it's you're in the thick of battle that's that's different in war time it's different here we're talk we're not in war we're alhamdulillah we're in peace when we're in war we'll talk about that Allah T ward off war from us inshallah we have Dua events after a person passes we recite the Quran in a group as a way of the Soul benefiting any guidance it's good uh I don't know why this question keeps popping up there must be something in the community about this but this is you know some people called it they'll wait 40 days after the person has passed and they'll do they'll gather or or the anniversary um of the death and the family will get together and each person will read a j of Quran any any good that we do for the deceased is given to the deceased as a general rule the Quran the Dua charity so on and so forth the prophet Sall wasallam said you know that our Deeds are cut except for three knowledge that we leave behind uh ongoing charity or or a Pious descendant that will make Dua for them um however just to comment our way as an umah is we don't celebrate the death of people we celebrate the birth of people so we celebrate the birth of the Prophet Alam the M of the Prophet we celebrate the m in the in Egypt for example we have a huge M for IM Hussein because the head of IM Hussein is in Cairo so we celebrate the birth of IM Hussein the birth of say Zab so on and and so forth so there is there's nothing wrong with this but I just want to highlight that our way is also to celebrate the Mad of a person not the death of a person can a kid call the aan when adults are present uh yes you don't have to be an adult to call the aan as long as the kid has discernment and can recite the aan and of course the aan is is a male only activity a woman can give the aama for women prayers but when it comes to the the the congregational prayer the aan can be done by a kid uh as long as they know the time has come in and they know the words of the aan and they can pronounce it and so on and so forth and we do that you know when one of the young kids does the recitation they give thean they're all good and if they make a mistake it's a fine you have to learn question huh that's question yeah well and look sometimes they make mistakes and that's fine because if you're not used to it then you know it's not like a natural thing to belt without that then so it's okay that people make mistakes and we can correct them what is your guidance if we have prayers led by the Imam in the new activity building and we have many following and praying in the present building and Courtyard with an audio and video feed is the prayer valid 100% as long as you can follow the Imam and the movements of the Imam and you are within the confines of the mosque or outside the mosque then you are fine there's no there's no there's nothing wrong with that part that you're covering as well I think we have a practical issue and you're familiar with it as well because in our offices we do the jamaa arrangement as well right and U we try to get um Imam or somebody do theba but it's not always possible as well so one of the things that we've run into practical issues on several jamas as well so is it permissible let's say if we doing the ICP over here J and we stream over there for theba part and somebody leads a Juma and somebody leads the prayers over there would that be considered permissible or is it out of bounds that won't work out of bounds I like that one it's out of bounds it won't work because the distance is too far okay so uh there have to be contiguous rows uh and and the Gap can exceed like 400 feet you know between the rows so um that won't work the like the TV radio streaming Juma won't work but if um you know if if if we had a huge Jama like there were like in Mecca you know there's like 300,000 people praying you know there have to be video feeds and stuff and and microphones to augment the sound but they're all contiguous so that's fine so as long as you know and you hear what's going on that's fine in in Islam in the Sharia in the premodern world there was a a people that was their job job they were called it what they would do is they would repeat what the IM would say and they would be spread out so that they would like yell and sometimes if the microphone goes off in our mosque that's somebody does that on so everyone can hear what's happening that's also normal so this is fine and and what we have here is fine inshah school students ask what I suggested is they can watch our video stream and then have a j on their own that fulfills the minimum requirements yeah or or they can watch our stream and then they can pray another way yeah so that's we can off that's a solution so you can watch the stream so you can hear like you're part of the community but then you know that you have to do a separate prayer so either you pray four raas or you do what we just said the minimal and pray the two raas of Juma that would work yeah so we could do the two but somebody would have to do the minimal yeah the minimum what we said is for the minim yeah feet if the lines are not contiguous okay so if there's a break what if I'm praying and my head covering Falls is my prayer valid as long as you catch it and you cover the same thing for a man or if you know like you're making R and your shirt comes up or something Falls If part of your a is exposed and you quickly cover it once you notice then that's fine but if it falls off if it falls off and it's like off off for for too long then you have broken the condition of prayer you have to exit the prayer well you've already exited the prayer you have to re-enter the prayer but as long as you catch it then it's excused inshallah can I offer my prayers in the plane while traveling what is your guidance as time zones change in the shaab as I've shared with you before we do not pray in the plane because one of the conditions for the shaf the later Shafi is that the prayer has to be contiguous with the Earth so the chefi jurist posited what happens if you're suspended in the air and they said in that case the prayer is suspended until you return to the Earth so the according to the Sha we do not pray on the plane however I do realize that that's a unique position and a minority position and most of the Other M will do do pray in the plane if you pray on the plane then you have the same conditions you have to make sure that you're facing the and you have to make sure that the time has come in and that can be challenging so you have to look outside the sun you probably combine your prayers anyway because you're traveling and shorten them um and whatnot but because of the difficulty I share with you the Shafi opinion um so that people have know that there's a dispensation so in the if you're a sh or if you follow that opinion then what happens is you're going to miss those prayers without sin and then when you land you're going to make up those prayer because they have to wake them up and inshallah there's no sin incurred because you are in a situation in what in in in which one of the Cardinal conditions of the prayer was not met or fulfilled if you're praying a the prayer you have to continually face the and you have 45 degree discrepancy so like from one year to you have this much discrepancy that you can vary vary it in if you're praying a Sunnah prayer then you can face the in the beginning and then you can move however way you want but if you're praying a f prayer you have to Contin continuously face the and if you are turned away from the then you have invalidated the prayer can I recite the Quran while I'm lying in bed I guess it says no have I to face the Kaa no you can recite the Quran anywhere and any way you want except if you are in a state of janaba in which case you just have to take a shower but that's you know not a ongoing situation so lying in bed standing people that remember Allah standing sitting and lying down can aah be done first and the Civil marriage performed after afterwards in the country that I live yes and that's the order that it should take place the nikah is the marriage and then the Civil marriage is the documentation of the ncah and then it certifies the marriage took place with the Islamic conditions and that people's rights are uh maintained so you should do the Civil marriage for sure but after the no we do we do it together they bring the marriage license yeah but but we do the ncah and fill out the license so it happens at the same time so that's the easier way to do it actually I don't think we we I don't think we we do it any other way right yeah yeah we don't do it any other way here okay uh there are several questions backtack about kadis um maybe I can summarize um yeah okay there are too many let me just summarize them so the the questions about kis and Ahmed and this is again a question that's come up from time to time uh any you know there are many sects in Islam and there are many groups and whatnot however there are those macro level issues that we all agree agree to as long as somebody agrees to the macro level issues then everyone's a Muslim and people just have different beliefs on lesser issues and that's fine and we coexist and you know we don't have a problem with that but if somebody violates one of the Cardinal uh you know macr level issues then they themselves not me they have left Islam they have chosen to leave Islam I didn't kick anyone out I have no authority to kick someone out but if someone doesn't believe in Muhammed and the basic things that that implies they're not a Muslim that's the definition of what a Muslim is as simple as that so I don't know what the kadis believe because every time I somebody talks to me about them or I talk to them I get 55 different answers if they believe that this guy was a prophet that he received Revelation uh that he's infallible that's an un Islamic belief then they have removed themselves from Islam I didn't remove them from Islam we didn't remove they have removed themselves from Islam they call themselves what they want they can pray however they want they it doesn't I don't care but they're not Muslim if they if they believe in that if they believe that this guy was a cool guy good guy muj guy important guy illuminated fine that then you're then you believe in what we believe in muhm it's a simple it's just very very simple type of situation so that's for them to answer any sect that deviates from the vast majority Norm of because we are the majority of of the Muslims you know 85 80 85% anyone that veers away from the the Shia call us the they even call us the they call us the majority anybody that deviates from that the simple thing is what is your point of deviation sometimes there are little Branch issues then you have your branch issue we don't do te of of each other but if somebody says uh you know I I I believe that Prophet Muhammad was a prophet only for the Arabs that's not what Muhammad means he was a prophet for for all of mankind so and there have been groups like that throughout history so that's what I have to say about about theis that being said uh whatever they say or whatever they believe that doesn't stop us from having good relations with everyone so just because somebody has a a belief that's taken them outside of Islam that's between them and Allah subh you know but we don't want to have conflict with anyone our job is not our mosque is open and we have manyani people that come to our mosque we have many Shia people that come to our MOS we have no problem with anyone but we're a Sunni mosque and we follow the Quran and Sunnah according to the Sunni imams and that's that's what we do but we are are because we are Sunni we open our arms to everyone so I don't want this to be an issue I don't want what I'm saying to say oh we have to go attack I'm not attacking anyone again if somebody doesn't believe in those basic they're very basic tenants then then they're not a Muslim there has to be a definition there has to be something that is Islam and something that's not Islam what is that muham and the basic implications of that that's it simple as that this is this is probably one of the most hotly debated issues in in in Pakistan right I think in in because of the role and because of the last 30 4 40 50 years and and this is in terms of declaring themel declaring them as non-muslims and not recognizing them as Muslims and from a government level perspective as well and I've had several conversation with several of my kadani friends the friends as well their position is that well um he was the he was not the prophet but he's the messenger right and I think and I don't understand the distinction and I get confused in that as well but also in terms of how the Pakistan government has actually treated the EMES as well and in terms of uh that has also been quite a bit of an issue as well so so I think the question that I have is in terms of do we as individuals or as a community or anybody has the authority if they calling themselves Muslims you know whether we whether they follow the teds or not that's between them and do we as a community or anybody the community or anybody at any level has the authority to call them as non-muslims or not so the authority to do that do one my friend don't know that is fatwa against them Saudi Mas Alazar all Muslim mutis fwa against them not only Pakistan all Muslim mu fwa against them go on the internet and check it the authority to to do that does not lie with individuals but it lies it lies within the with either a judge or a former Al Muti um so yes I mean I can understand why the Pakistani government would have a lot of problems because this is a subversive this is a subversive thing to the identity of Pakistan it's like during the Arab Spring we had all of this like Shia infiltration in Egypt I mean you can't come to a country like Egypt and do Shia hus yet it's not going to work at all at all the people themselves forget the the people themselves will reject that what are you talking about that we love in egpt and and now you're coming to tell us about we're the one we have in Egypt so it doesn't work so I can understand why it's it is a a disruptive thing to to you know it's a security issue for Pakistan or for these countries I'm speaking from the religious point of view only I don't know the inner working of Pakistan zindabad okay I don't know anything about Pakistan or the details of Pakistan I love all my Muslim brothers and sisters but I understand where that's coming from again he's not a prophet but he's a messenger that doesn't work for me the prophet s that's it full stop don't play with words not you but I'm saying so this playing with words no he's not he's but the that recitation of the verse has both and it's two recitations of that same verse Subhan Allah so that stuff doesn't work do you say that he receives Revelation and that he's infallible yes then that's not Islam you you love the guy you think he's super cool he's thei he's the okay that's a issue of bid but I don't have to do for us it's very simple from the religious point of view my understanding is that theis also are they groups they're are subgroups right they're not all all one so and I don't know the names of the subgroups but yes as the as the our captain mentioned there are many fetas against them but the fet was against theis are against those who say that he is a prophet after s Muhammad that receives Revelation because that's just not compatible with our belief so I mean I mean obviously he was not the M but okay fine they want to believe he the M that won't take them outside of Islam but that's an issue of bid that's a belief that's not correct but that's not an incorrect belief that removes you from Islam so we have things that remove you from Islam and many many things that don't remove you from Islam like a Muslim that drinks alcohol like a Muslim who doesn't pray because they're lazy they're still a Muslim it's a sin it's bad but they don't pray because they're lazy but a Muslim comes and says there is no prayer prayer is only here that's disbelief because you have violated something that we say is necessarily known from the religion anybody who negates an issue of consensus an issue of what is necessarily known by religion that removes them from Islam but those things are very few you have to be mad to to say some of those things that's what we're talking about love to everybody okay um there's a few questions about like what Vick to say and things like that I'm also going to lump these together the prophet wasallam said the best thing that I and the prophets before me said was so is a good the prophet wasam also said that my heart is clouded throughout the day and I seek from Allah subh 100 times a basic that you can do morning and evening that encompasses everything is 100 times to doat on the prophet 100 times with any formam 100 times that's a basic VI that that kind of checks a lot of boxes of all of the Dua of all of the Hadith that talk about the meritorious Act of I would start with that and we can build on that inshallah now I'm listening you can do all of that but I'm just trying to give something general because the questioner asked many should I say this should I say that so I'm just saying something general for people to do okay we grew up listen listening about a Hadith that goes something like most women will be put in the Hellfire on the day of judgment please explain this in detail it just does not sound right especially when there is another one that says Paradise is under the feet of a mother in addition the amount of changes a woman's body goes through such as puberty pregnancies menopause Etc it seems most women should be guaranteed Jenna and not the Hellfire by the prophet the Hadith does not say that most women will be in Hellfire the Hadith says that most PE the the the greater gender in Hellfire are women not that most there's a big difference between the two and the prophet Sall wasallam was asked why and he said because you um you have a tendency to negate the good that was done to you by your spouses so a man will be good to his wife and he'll make one mistake and she'll be upset I haven't seen anything good from you at all so the prophet qualified that but also Allah subhana tells us in the Quran Allah gives us Allah's given you an example of a Believer the wife of pharaoh build for me a house in paradise and save me from pharaoh and then the next and then Allah gives us Mary as an example so there are women Saints there are According to some opinions women prophets like some say that Mary was a prophet the mother of Moses was a prophet that was the position of ibam and whatnot so there are plenty examples amongst the women uh so that Hadith if you just change the wording of the question to understand what it means hopefully that will make more sense as far as what the questioner said about the changes that a woman goes through absolutely and that's why Allah T has advised us to be kind to women not the other way around Allah T has the prophet has told us you know be uh gentle with the fra with those who are fragile Allah T has advised men to be more compassionate with women exactly for this reason and yes Paradise is at the feet of the mother and yes our duty is to our mother three times before it is to our father and all of those things so rather than focus on statistically who is more in the Hellfire and who just focus on yourself being the best version of yourself and inshallah you'll be fine inshallah I have an inquiry about figurines which I have inherited or received as gifts they are art pieces and since I grew up in a Catholic household I'm not sure if I should keep them or not if not what would I do with them well if the figurines are Catholic figurines I would you know give them to your local Catholic Church I guess or a Catholic neighbor if the figurines are just figurines because people like to collect that then uh you know if they have sentimental value and you want to hold on to them for that reason you can um you can hold on to them what dides the question say I'm not sure if I should keep them or not if not what should I do with them yeah so if there are figurines of like Christ and Mary and you know C you know Christian type of situ things or things of a religious nature that I would you know I would remove from the house for OB VI reasons but if there are things that you inherited from your parents or your grandparents and they have value or sentimental value and they're not of a religious nature then there's no necessary prohibition the prohibition against s the prohibition it's not against pictures that's a false translation of the Hadith it's a Prohibition against statues that are placed for the purposes of worshiping worshiping the statue or Idol or a grandis somebody that's what's prohibited but if you have something small or like a a child's toy or something like that but that's not done with the purposes of worship so that in and of itself it would not be impermissible in the context of what the questioner asked we still have some time right 10 minutes five minutes okay I'll try to do one or two more questions clearly I won't get through them all so I'll have to punt these to the next one in I always promise myself not to miss uh my prayers but I miss them what can I do can I make up for the missed ones all missed prayers must be made up no matter how many are the Miss prayers so that's all you have to do is you miss the prayer make sure that you make it up you have a deficit you have a backlog of Miss prayers for several weeks months years every time you pray a f the prayer stand up and pray another further prayer to make it up until you've made them all up and then the last question I wanted to ask if we are allowed to eat kosher meat when halal meat is not readily available kosher meat is halal from the Sharia point of view because it's meat that is slaughtered um and uh it fulfills our obligations for the slaughtered meat so from the purely Sharia point of view yes it's permissible to eat kosher meats and and chicken um that is exactly what Allah T says in the Quran that the food of the people ofab is permissible for us um and we have about 15 more questions so I apologize we'll get to those in the next one we'll we'll schedule something else for next month inshallah for [Music] [Music]
