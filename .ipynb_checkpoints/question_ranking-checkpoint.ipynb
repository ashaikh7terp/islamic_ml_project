      "Based on the provided contexts, Islam can be understood as a broad and inclusive faith defined primarily by the declaration of the shahada and facing the qibla, encompassing various sects such as Sunnis and Shias, all considered Muslim unless they violate fundamental principles (Context 4). Islam is described as a beautiful, tolerant, peaceful, and easygoing way of life (Context 2). Additionally, Islam involves having the basic elements necessary to practice it, which can be maintained even in non-Muslim lands (Context 3). The understanding of Islam can be approached as a comprehensive framework or mindset, as suggested by the mention of an introductory class called \"the Muslim mind\" aiming to provide a 360-degree view of Islam (Context 1).\n",

      "Based on the provided context, the difference between the Shafi and Hanafi schools mentioned relates specifically to the ruling on reading from the mushaf (Qur'an) during fardh or sunnah prayers:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Hanafi school holds that reading from the mushaf in prayer invalidates the prayer because the movement involved in holding and flipping the pages is considered too much.\n",
      "- The Shafi school allows reading from the mushaf during prayer as long as it does not distract the person or involve excessive movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This difference of opinion is noted in Contexts 1 and 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the main difference highlighted here is regarding the permissibility of reading from the mushaf during prayer, with the Hanafi school disallowing it and the Shafi school permitting it under certain conditions.\n",
